# Remote Machine Management

> Living document. Update this, don't create new versions.

AgentWire can manage AI agent sessions on remote machines via SSH. This guide covers adding, removing, and configuring remote machines.

---

## Adding a Machine

### CLI (Recommended)

```bash
agentwire machine add <id> --host <host> --user <user> --projects-dir <path>
```

Example:

```bash
agentwire machine add gpu-server --host 192.168.1.50 --user ubuntu --projects-dir ~/projects
```

### Portal UI

Machine registration is CLI-only today — the portal sidebar's Machines section
is read-only. It lists machines (with a live SSH-reachability status dot) and lets you
spawn a new session on one, but has no add/remove controls.

---

## Removing a Machine

### CLI

```bash
agentwire machine remove <id>
```

This:
- Removes from `machines.json`
- Prints manual cleanup reminders (SSH config entry, GitHub deploy keys, remote VM/user teardown, portal restart)

---

## Machine CLI Commands

```bash
# List all machines with connection status
agentwire machine list

# Add a machine
agentwire machine add <id> --host <host> --user <user> --projects-dir <path>

# Remove a machine (portal-side cleanup)
agentwire machine remove <id>
```

### Machine List Output

```
Registered machines (2):

  gpu-server
    Host: 192.168.1.50
    Projects: ~/projects
    Status: ✓ tunnel

  do-2
    Host: 167.99.123.45
    Projects: ~/projects
    Status: ✗ no tunnel
```

`Status` reflects whether an `autossh` process for that machine is currently
running (`pgrep -f "autossh.*<machine_id>"`), not a reachability ping.

---

## Session Operations on Remote Machines

All session commands support the `session@machine` format:

```bash
# Create session on remote machine
agentwire new -s myproject@gpu-server

# Create worktree session on remote
agentwire new -s myproject/feature@gpu-server

# Send prompt to remote session
agentwire send -s myproject@gpu-server "run the tests"

# Read output from remote session
agentwire output -s myproject@gpu-server -n 100

# Kill remote session
agentwire kill -s myproject@gpu-server

# List all sessions (includes remote)
agentwire list
```

---

## Minimum Specs (Remote)

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| RAM | 1GB | 2GB+ |
| Storage | 10GB | 20GB+ |
| CPU | 1 vCPU | 2+ vCPU |

**Note:** The LLM runs on your API provider's servers - remote machines only need resources for Python and file operations. No GPU required for Hermes Agent sessions (GPU only needed for TTS with Chatterbox).

---

## SSH Configuration

AgentWire uses your existing SSH configuration. Ensure you can connect:

```bash
ssh <machine-id>  # Should connect without password prompt
```

For passwordless access, add your SSH key:

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@host
```

Or add to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host gpu-server
    HostName 192.168.1.50
    User ubuntu
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

**SSH ControlMaster connection multiplexing (built in).** AgentWire applies
ControlMaster flags to **every** `ssh` it spawns (see `agentwire/ssh.py` —
`ssh_base_opts()`), so the first remote op to a host opens a master connection
and parks its socket under `~/.ssh/sockets/`; subsequent ops ride that socket
and skip the handshake (~90–140ms saved on loopback, 300–500ms over a VPN). The
socket dir is created on demand; if it can't be created the flags are dropped
and ssh just re-handshakes (no command is lost). Nothing to configure.

To get the same speedup for **your own** interactive `ssh`/`scp`/`rsync` from
the shell, add the equivalent to `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host *
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
    ControlPersist 600
```

Inspect or tear down a master by hand: `ssh -O check <host>` /
`ssh -O exit <host>`.

## Tailscale Mesh Underlay (no inbound port 22)

> Optional. SSH stays the transport — Tailscale is just the network it rides.
> This buys the "no public inbound port / identity-based / NAT-traversal"
> security story with **zero application-code change** (see research in
> `docs/wiki/research/orchestration-transport-alternatives.md`).

Today every managed machine needs reachable SSH — typically public port 22 or a
hole-punched forward. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) (a managed WireGuard
mesh) gives every machine a stable private `100.x` address on your *tailnet*,
reachable from any other enrolled machine regardless of NAT, with **no inbound
port open to the public internet**. Point `machines.json` at the tailnet
addresses and SSH rides the encrypted mesh.

### Setup (per machine)

1. **Install Tailscale** on the orchestrator and every managed machine:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   sudo tailscale up            # opens a browser/device-auth link
   ```
   macOS: `brew install --cask tailscale` (or the App Store app), then `tailscale up`.

2. **Grab each machine's tailnet address** (stable, survives reboots/IP changes):
   ```bash
   tailscale ip -4              # e.g. 100.101.102.103
   tailscale status            # also shows MagicDNS names like gpu-server.tail-scale.ts.net
   ```

3. **Point `machines.json` at the tailnet address** (or MagicDNS name) instead
   of the public IP:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "gpu-server",
     "host": "100.101.102.103",
     "user": "ubuntu",
     "projects_dir": "~/projects"
   }
   ```
   MagicDNS names work too (`"host": "gpu-server.tail-scale.ts.net"`) and read
   better. Verify: `ssh ubuntu@100.101.102.103 echo ok`.

4. **Close public port 22.** Once every machine reaches the others over the
   tailnet, drop inbound 22 from the public internet at the firewall / cloud
   security group / `ufw`:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow in on tailscale0 to any port 22   # SSH only over the tailnet
   sudo ufw deny  in            to any port 22       # block public 22
   ```
   (Cloud hosts: remove the `0.0.0.0/0 :22` rule from the security group; keep a
   console/out-of-band path so you can't lock yourself out.)

ControlMaster multiplexing (above) stacks on top — the per-command handshake the
mesh adds (a few ms WireGuard overhead) is paid once per host, then reused.

### Pairing with the public portal (Cloudflare Tunnel)

These solve two different exposure problems and compose cleanly:

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Machine-to-machine SSH (orchestrator ↔ managed boxes) | **Tailscale mesh** — private `100.x`, no public port |
| Public access to the **portal** (your phone, anywhere) | **Cloudflare Tunnel** — outbound-only, no inbound port (see [`remote-access.md`](remote-access.md)) |

Neither opens an inbound port on a managed machine. The portal is reachable from
the open internet via the tunnel; SSH between machines never leaves the tailnet.

### Optional later step: Tailscale SSH

[Tailscale SSH](https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh) can terminate the
SSH connection itself using **tailnet device identity / your SSO**, dropping
`authorized_keys` management entirely — access is governed by tailnet ACLs
instead of per-host key files. Enable per node with `tailscale up --ssh` and an
ACL `ssh` rule. **Not required** for the mesh underlay above (plain `sshd` over
the tailnet works fine); it's a follow-up if you want to retire key
distribution.

## machines.json Schema

Machine configuration is stored in `~/.agentwire/machines.json`, keyed under a
`machines` array (not a bare top-level array):

```json
{
  "machines": [
    {
      "id": "gpu-server",
      "host": "192.168.1.50",
      "user": "ubuntu",
      "projects_dir": "~/projects"
    },
    {
      "id": "do-2",
      "host": "167.99.123.45",
      "user": "root",
      "projects_dir": "~/projects"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier, used in `session@machine` format |
| `host` | IP address or hostname |
| `user` | SSH username |
| `projects_dir` | Base directory for projects on the remote machine |

## Machine Context for AI Agents

### The `~/.agentwire/machine/` Pattern

Each machine should have a `~/.agentwire/machine/.hermes.md` — a living document describing that machine's role, services, venvs, paths, and any platform-specific gotchas.

When an AI agent needs to do ops work on a remote machine (manage services, install packages, debug the box itself), spawn a Hermes Agent session in `~/.agentwire/machine/` rather than SSHing and running ad-hoc commands. The agent picks up both the user's global Hermes context (`.hermes.md` / `AGENTS.md`) and `~/.agentwire/machine/.hermes.md` (machine context) automatically, giving it full situational awareness without needing to rediscover everything.

```bash
# Spawn an ops session on a remote machine (replace `my-server` with your hostname)
ssh my-server
cd ~/.agentwire/machine
hermes chat --cli  # gets both global prefs and machine context

# Or spawn via agentwire from the Mac (remote target is the @machine suffix)
agentwire new -s my-server-ops@my-server -p ~/.agentwire/machine
```

### What to Put in `~/.agentwire/machine/.hermes.md`

- **Machine identity** — OS, hardware specs (CPU, GPU, RAM), role in the fleet
- **Services** — what runs here, how to start/stop/check them, service file locations
- **Python venvs** — what each venv is for, how to create new ones for the platform
- **Key paths** — config files, scripts, data directories
- **Platform gotchas** — WSL paths, sudo requirements, non-standard tool locations
- **Install notes** — anything non-obvious that tripped you up (saves re-discovery)

### Example Structure

```
~/.agentwire/
├── config.yaml          # Main agentwire config
├── machines.json        # Registered remote machines
├── voices/              # TTS voice reference files
├── scripts/             # Machine-specific helper scripts
│   ├── tts              # TTS management wrapper
│   ├── tts-start        # Quick start
│   └── wsl-startup      # Boot hook (WSL example)
└── machine/
    └── .hermes.md      # Machine context for AI agents ← THIS
```

### Scripts in `~/.agentwire/scripts/`

Machine-specific helper scripts live here — TTS management, startup hooks, service wrappers, etc. This is the canonical location. Scripts in `~/bin/` should symlink here so they're on PATH but the source of truth stays in one place.

These scripts are not managed by agentwire and not version-controlled — they're local to each machine because different machines have different roles.

## WSL2 Machines

Running agentwire on Windows Subsystem for Linux has a few differences from bare Linux:

- **GPU access** — CUDA works normally; `nvidia-smi` is at `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/nvidia-smi` (not in default PATH)
- **Driver location** — GPU driver lives on the Windows host; never install Linux GPU drivers
- **CUDA toolkit** — Install `cuda-nvcc-12-4` etc. individually; the `cuda-toolkit-12-4` metapackage fails on Ubuntu 24.04 (requires `libtinfo5`, which is not available)
- **Systemd** — WSL2 supports systemd user services (`systemctl --user`); use for persistent services like TTS
- **Port exposure** — Ports are accessible from the Windows host and via SSH tunnels as normal
- **Boot hook** — WSL doesn't have a traditional init; use a startup script called from Windows Task Scheduler or Windows Terminal profile

### Recommended WSL Service Pattern

```bash
# ~/.agentwire/scripts/wsl-startup
#!/bin/bash
sudo service ssh start
systemctl --user start agentwire-tts.service
```

```ini
# ~/.config/systemd/user/agentwire-tts.service
