# Scheduled Workloads

Reliable headless task execution for unattended and automated agent workflows.

---

## Overview

Two paths for running scheduled work, picked per task:

1. **`agentwire ensure` tasks** — Reliable session management + task execution with lifecycle hooks. A full Hermes Agent session runs a single prompt from `.agentwire.tasks.yml`. Best for multi-step agent work that needs its own branch / PR / MCP tools.
2. **Tasks in `.agentwire.tasks.yml`** — Named tasks with pre/prompt/post phases and branch management — the substrate for path #1.

Both are orchestrated by `~/.agentwire/scheduler.yaml` and the AgentWire scheduler daemon.

---

## Task Definition Schema

Define tasks in `.agentwire.tasks.yml` (a sibling of `.agentwire.yml`, split out in #720) — **keep that file gitignored**. Worktree-dispatched runs check out HEAD, so if the file is tracked, uncommitted live edits to a task prompt are silently ignored and the run executes the stale committed version. Gitignored, the live file is seeded into every worktree via `projects.worktrees.copy_files` (default `[".env", ".agentwire.yml", ".agentwire.tasks.yml"]`) and always wins. See the `agentwire-project-config` skill.

`.agentwire.tasks.yml` is **protected control-plane** — a policed agent can't write it directly. Authoring it is propose-and-promote: draft to `.agentwire.tasks.proposed.yml`, then a human runs `agentwire tasks review` and `agentwire tasks promote`. See [Damage control](../internals/damage-control.md#task-execution-config-split-agentwiretasksyml-720).

**Legacy inline tasks are dead weight (#736).** Tasks that predate the #720/#721 split still living under a `tasks:` key in `.agentwire.yml` do **not** run — the executor reads only `.agentwire.tasks.yml`, with no runtime fallback. Migrate once: `agentwire tasks migrate` stages the inline block to `.agentwire.tasks.proposed.yml`, then `agentwire tasks review` + `agentwire tasks promote` lands it; finally delete the dead `tasks:` block from `.agentwire.yml`. `agentwire doctor` flags any project still in the un-migrated state.

      save: ~/logs/{{ task }}.log    # Save captured output here
```

## Branch Management

When `starting_ref` is set, the task lifecycle handles all git plumbing automatically:

**Pre-task:**
1. `git checkout starting_ref` (+ `git pull --ff-only` if it's a branch)
2. Create `work_branch` (default: `agent/<task>-<YYYY-MM-DD>`, auto-deduped if exists)
3. `git checkout -b work_branch`

**Post-task:**
1. Commit any uncommitted changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "chore: agent task <task>"`
2. `git push -u origin work_branch`
3. Open PR: `gh pr create --base pr_target --head work_branch [--draft]`
4. PR URL is stored in summary file (available as `{{ pr_url }}` in post phase)
5. `git checkout starting_ref` — reset working state

**Edge cases:**
- `starting_ref` not found → task fails (exit code 4)
- No changes after task → no commit, no push, no PR (graceful skip)
- `gh` not in PATH → warning logged, task continues without PR

**Variables available in post phase when branch management is active:**

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{ work_branch }}` | Branch name used for agent's work |
| `{{ pr_url }}` | URL of the created PR (empty if no PR was created) |

### Sharing a working dir with a live session (#854)

`agentwire new` refuses to attach a session to a directory that is already some
other live session's working dir — two agents in one tree means dirty state
bleeding across and branches mixing. That guard is written for the *accidental*
case; a scheduled dispatch is declared intent (the task config names the
project, on a schedule, on purpose), so `ensure` opts out of it — but only when
the dispatch does no branch work of its own.

The derivation keys off `starting_ref`, since that is the field that makes
`ensure` check out, branch, and reset the tree:

| Task | Guard | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| no `starting_ref` | **off** — dispatch proceeds | branchless: fans out, writes files, opens no branches |
| `starting_ref` set | **on** — dispatch refuses | mutates the shared checkout; use a worktree task instead |

Set `allow_shared_dir` explicitly to override in either direction — `false`
re-arms the guard for a branchless task whose *prompt* does git work, `true`
opens it for a `starting_ref` task whose tree is known to be private. The
dispatch never uses `--force` for this: force would kill-replace a live
same-name session.

---

## Context Inheritance

`starting_session` forks a session's Hermes conversation history into the task session before running, giving the agent pre-loaded context instead of a cold start:

```yaml
tasks:
  continue-payments-refactor:
    prompt: "Continue the payments refactor from where we left off"
    starting_session: payments-loaded   # Fork Hermes context from here
    starting_ref: feature/payments      # Also start from this branch
```

When the task runs, `payments-loaded`'s Hermes conversation history is copied into the new session. The agent starts with full prior context.

**Fallback:** If `starting_session` doesn't exist, a warning is logged and the task runs with a fresh session — not a hard failure.

---

## Per-Task Role Override

`role` loads a specialized persona for that task, overriding the session's default roles:

```yaml
tasks:
  write-tests:
    prompt: "Write unit tests for the payments module"
    role: piinpoint-test-writer    # Specialized test-writing persona

  lint-cleanup:
    prompt: "Fix all lint errors"
    role: task-runner              # Minimal, focused persona

  pr-review:
    prompt: "Review the open PRs and leave detailed comments"
    role: code-reviewer            # Review-oriented persona
```

Role applies at session creation time. With `exit_on_complete: true` (default), each task run creates a fresh session with the specified role loaded.

---

## Built-in Variables

| Variable | Available In | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `{{ var_name }}` | prompt, on_task_end, post | Output from pre command |
| `{{ summary_file }}` | on_task_end, post | Path to current run's summary file |
| `{{ output }}` | post | Captured session output |
| `{{ status }}` | on_task_end, post | `complete`, `incomplete`, or `failed` |
| `{{ summary }}` | on_task_end, post | One-line summary from summary file |
| `{{ work_branch }}` | post | Branch created by branch management |
| `{{ pr_url }}` | post | PR URL created by branch management |
| `{{ date }}` | all | YYYY-MM-DD |
| `{{ time }}` | all | HH:MM:SS |
| `{{ datetime }}` | all | Full ISO timestamp |
| `{{ session }}` | all | Session name |
| `{{ task }}` | all | Task name |
| `{{ project_root }}` | all | Absolute path to project directory |
| `{{ attempt }}` | prompt, on_task_end, post | Current attempt number (1-based) |

`pre:` commands **produce** variables — they cannot use `{{ }}` syntax.
`prompt`, `on_task_end`, and `post` **consume** variables.
Environment variables use `${ENV_VAR}` syntax (expanded at runtime).

---

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Complete (`status: complete`) |
| 1 | Failed (`status: failed`) |
| 2 | Incomplete (`status: incomplete`) |
| 3 | Lock conflict (session locked, `--wait-lock` not used) |
| 4 | Pre-phase failure (command failed, `required` empty, `validate` failed, `starting_ref` not found) |
| 5 | Timeout (hard timeout exceeded) |
| 6 | Session error (couldn't create or connect) |
| 7 | Usage limit (`usage_limit` — session parked awaiting reset; scheduler skips dispatch) |

---

## `ensure` Command

```bash
agentwire ensure -s session --task name                        # Run named task
agentwire ensure -s session --task name --lock-timeout 600      # Custom lock-wait timeout
agentwire ensure -s session --task name --wait-lock             # Wait if locked
agentwire ensure -s session --task name --dry-run               # Preview without executing
```

**Lifecycle:**
1. Acquire lock for session (fail if locked, or wait with `--wait-lock`)
2. Session exists? If not, create it
3. Session healthy? If not, recreate it
4. Session idle? If not, wait
5. If `starting_session` set: fork Hermes conversation context
6. If `starting_ref` set: checkout branch, create work branch
7. Run pre-commands, validate outputs
8. Send templated prompt
9. Agent works → goes idle → system sends summary prompt
10. Agent writes `.agentwire/task-summary-{session}-{task}-{datetime}.md`
11. If `on_task_end` defined: send user's final prompt, wait for idle
12. If `starting_ref` set: commit changes, push, open PR
13. Run post-commands with `{{ status }}`, `{{ pr_url }}`, etc.
14. Release lock, exit session

## Scheduler Integration

> **`scheduler.yaml` holds your task definitions only.** The daemon treats it
> as read-only and never writes to it. Run-state (last run, status, summaries,
> gate commits, worktree/PR tracking) is persisted to a separate
> `~/.agentwire/scheduler-state.yaml`, written atomically with rotated backups
> (`scheduler-state.yaml.bak1..bak5`). This keeps machine-written state from
> ever corrupting hand-authored tasks.

Schedule tasks in `~/.agentwire/scheduler.yaml`:

```yaml
tasks:
  nightly-tests:
    project: ~/projects/piinpoint
    session: piinpoint-tests
    task: write-tests
    posture: auto              # Posture override
    roles: [task-runner]
    once: true                 # Auto-disable after first run
    schedule:
      every: 1m
      not_before: "22:00"
      not_after: "06:00"

  nightly-lint:
    project: ~/projects/piinpoint
    session: piinpoint-lint
    task: lint-cleanup
    posture: auto
    schedule:
      after: nightly-tests
      delay: 2m

  morning-report:
    project: ~/projects/piinpoint
    session: piinpoint-report
    task: morning-report
    schedule:
      after: [nightly-tests, nightly-lint]
      delay: 5m
    post:
      - "agentwire scheduler report --since 12h --artifact"
```

### One-Time and Limited Tasks

Tasks can auto-disable after a set number of runs:

```yaml
tasks:
  tonight-scaffold:
    # ...
    once: true        # Run once, then auto-disable (shorthand for max_runs: 1)
    schedule:
      every: 1m

  quarterly-report:
    # ...
    max_runs: 4       # Run 4 times then auto-disable
    schedule:
      every: day
      at: "09:00"
```

- `once: true` — shorthand for `max_runs: 1`
- `max_runs: N` — auto-disables after N dispatches, logs `task_disabled` event
- Re-enable with `agentwire scheduler enable <task-name>`

---

## Morning Dashboard

After unattended tasks run, generate a summary report:

```bash
agentwire scheduler report --since 8h           # Print summary + artifact path
agentwire scheduler report --since 8h --artifact  # Also open in portal
```

The HTML report includes: task name, status badge, branch, PR link, duration, and one-line summary. PR URLs are populated automatically when tasks use `starting_ref` + `work_branch`.

---

## `auto` — Recommended Posture

For unattended work, use `auto` instead of `bypass`:

```yaml
# .agentwire.yml
posture: auto
```

Both `auto` and `bypass` map to `--yolo` on Hermes — there is no Auto Mode classifier. Safety comes from the damage-control `pre_tool_call` hooks (300+ rules), Hermes's HARDLINE blocklist, and the `--checkpoints` rollback flag layered on top. Dangerous actions (force push to main, mass deletion, credential exfiltration) are blocked by the hooks; HARDLINE patterns fire even under `--yolo`.

`bypass` has no *additional* safety checks. `auto` and `bypass` currently enforce the identical hook-and-blocklist layer; keep the distinction in `.agentwire.yml` for clarity and future fidelity.

See `../sessions/hermes-safety-posture.md` for the full posture, approval configuration, and constraints.

## Full Unattended Workflow Example

```yaml
# ~/projects/piinpoint/.agentwire.yml
posture: auto
roles:
  - task-runner
```

```yaml
# ~/projects/piinpoint/.agentwire.tasks.yml
tasks:
  write-tests:
    prompt: "Write missing unit tests for recent changes in the payments module. Focus on edge cases."
    starting_ref: main
    pr_target: main
    pr_draft: true
    role: piinpoint-test-writer
    retries: 1
    idle_timeout: 60
    exit_on_complete: true

  lint-cleanup:
    prompt: "Run the linter, fix all auto-fixable issues, commit the fixes."
    starting_ref: main
    pr_target: main
    pr_draft: false
    role: task-runner
    exit_on_complete: true

  morning-report:
    prompt: "Summarize what was accomplished. Check the PRs that were opened."
    post:
      - "agentwire scheduler report --since 12h --artifact"
    exit_on_complete: true
```

## When to Use What

| Workflow | Tool | Best For |
|----------|------|----------|
| Predefined recurring tasks | **Scheduler** | Nightly tests, lint, reports |
| Quick one-off tasks | **`agentwire ensure`** | Ad-hoc task execution |

```yaml
# ~/.agentwire/scheduler.yaml
tasks:
  nightly-tests:
    project: ~/projects/piinpoint
    session: piinpoint-tests
    task: write-tests
    posture: auto
    once: true
    schedule:
      every: 1m
      not_before: "22:00"
      not_after: "06:00"

  nightly-lint:
    project: ~/projects/piinpoint
    session: piinpoint-lint
    task: lint-cleanup
    posture: auto
    once: true
    schedule:
      after: nightly-tests
      delay: 2m

  morning-report:
    project: ~/projects/piinpoint
    session: piinpoint-report
    task: morning-report
    schedule:
      after: [nightly-tests, nightly-lint]
      delay: 5m
```

Each night: tests task and lint task each fork their own branch, do their work, and open a draft PR. Morning report runs after both, generates an HTML dashboard showing statuses and PR links.

## Daemon Liveness and the Single-Dispatcher Rule (#873)

**One board, one dispatcher.** Two `agentwire scheduler serve` processes against
the same `scheduler.yaml` double-dispatch tasks: the same task fires twice, the
first attempt usually times out, a later one completes, and the board shows both.

Liveness is determined from the daemon's own live-state file
(`~/.agentwire/scheduler-live.json`), which records the writing process's `pid`
on every loop tick. `live_daemon_state()` (`agentwire/scheduler/report.py`) is
the single source of truth: it returns the state only when that PID is alive
*and* its `ps` argv contains both `scheduler` and `serve` as whole words. A
leftover file from a stopped daemon therefore reads as not-running, and a
recycled PID can't masquerade as one.

The whole-word test on **both** words is load-bearing, not fussiness. A
recycled PID is quite likely to be another agentwire command: `agentwire
scheduler live --watch` is not a dispatcher, but a substring test for
`scheduler` accepts it — which would misreport liveness *and* make `serve`,
`start`, and portal autostart all refuse, leaving the board with **no**
dispatcher. Only `scheduler serve` dispatches.

This replaced `tmux_session_exists("agentwire-scheduler")`, which only ever knew
about daemons tmux itself hosts. A daemon under an external supervisor (launchd
`RunAtLoad` + `KeepAlive`) has no tmux session, so it:

- reported as `stopped` while it was actively dispatching, and
- caused `agentwire doctor` to **skip** the daemon-staleness check — the
  diagnostic that catches a wedged daemon — exactly where it was most needed.

Everything that asks "is the scheduler running" now routes through the same
check:

| Surface | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `agentwire scheduler status` | Reports `running (pid N, tmux \| external supervisor)` |
| `agentwire scheduler serve` | **Refuses to start** if a daemon is already live (`--force` overrides) |
| `agentwire scheduler start` | Refuses when a daemon is live outside tmux |
| `agentwire scheduler stop` | Says "running outside tmux — stop it through its supervisor" instead of the false "not running" |
| `agentwire doctor` | Runs the staleness check for tmux and non-tmux daemons alike |
| Portal autostart (`scheduler.autostart`) | Skips with a logged notice when any daemon is live, not just a tmux one |

`scheduler.autostart` still defaults to `true`. With the guard in place that is
safe alongside an external supervisor: the portal checks first and logs why it
declined, rather than silently adding a second dispatcher on every launch.

**One transitional state:** a daemon started before this change writes no `pid`,
so nothing can verify it. `doctor` flags that explicitly (`records no PID —
predates the PID-based liveness check`) rather than reporting it as stopped.
Restarting the daemon clears it — which a rebuild already requires anyway.

---

## Bounding a Task: `max_duration` (#867)

Completion is **agent-driven**. `ensure` sends the prompt and then waits for the
agent to go idle, the idle hook to prompt for a summary, and the summary file to
appear. Nothing in that chain has a clock. An agent that never goes idle — wedged
on an unrecognized dialog, or blocked inside a long tool call — produces no
completion signal and no error, so the wait simply never ends.

`max_duration` is the wall clock that bounds a single attempt:

```yaml
tasks:
  memory-manager:
    max_duration: 1800   # give up after 30 min (default: 0 = unbounded)
```

On expiry the attempt reports `incomplete`, the summary names the reason
(`Task exceeded max_duration (1800s) after 1802s — the agent never signalled
completion`), and the session is torn down — otherwise the wedged agent keeps
running until the scheduler's 4h `dispatch_max_runtime` process-group kill.

**It is a wall clock, not an idle timer.** It cannot distinguish a wedged agent
from a slow one, so a task that legitimately runs long should set it generously
or leave it at `0`. `idle_timeout` is *not* an equivalent bound: agentwire does
not control the harness's idle threshold, so that field configures the summary
handoff, not a ceiling on the run.

### Keys agentwire doesn't read are now reported

`max_duration` existed in `.agentwire.tasks.yml` files across the fleet long
before anything read it — a task that looked bounded at 30 minutes was in fact
unbounded. Unknown keys in a task block are now surfaced by `agentwire task
show` / `task validate` / `tasks review`, and warned about at dispatch:

```
Warning: task 'memory-manager' sets keys agentwire ignores: max_durationn
```

Reported, never fatal: a typo must not break a 04:00 dispatch. `description` is
allowed as a deliberate no-op annotation.

---

## Prompt Delivery Is Verified, and Its Result Acted On (#889)

A scheduled dispatch's prompt is pasted with `session_ready.send_verified` — the
same call `agentwire send`, `prompt_router`, `council`, `session_cli` and the
`msg` drain all make — and **`ensure` fails the attempt when it can't be
confirmed.**

Until #889 this one path still used the blind paste (`pane_manager.send_to_target`):
paste, sleep a fixed **1.0s**, press Enter, sleep a fixed **0.5s**, press Enter.
Two problems, and the second is the one that hurt:

1. **The delays are constants; the paste is not.** A task interpolating a large
   `pre` output pastes tens of KB. `send_verified` polls for the text to appear
   with `LAND_TIMEOUT = 8.0s` precisely because — in its own comment — "a large
   paste renders slowly". The blind path allowed 1.0s. `send_to_target`'s
   docstring already recorded the failure class: *"Skipping the second [Enter]
   leaves the prompt stuck in the input — the failure that hung the scheduler at
   8am."*
2. **`send_to_pane` returns `None`.** So `ensure` could not distinguish
   "delivered" from "sitting unsubmitted in the input box". It went straight into
   `wait_for_completion_signal` and waited for a signal that could never arrive —
   which is how a task with nobody watching burns hours in silence rather than
   reporting an error.

Fixing only the first half would have been the trap: routing through
`send_verified` while ignoring what it returns reproduces the same silence with
more machinery. **A dispatch that reports "prompt never landed" is strictly
better than one that waits for a signal that cannot arrive.**

| Send | On unconfirmed delivery |
|---|---|
| Task prompt | Attempt **fails** with a named reason; retried if `retries` is set; never falls through to the completion wait |
| `on_task_end` | **Warns** on stderr only — the task already reported its status, and an unsent epilogue must not rewrite a completed run as failed |

**False negatives are handled, not ignored.** A `False` from `send_verified` can
also mean the paste fully submitted and only the *confirm* read was ambiguous (a
laggy host blowing the submit budget). The per-attempt marker (#839) rides inside
the pasted text, so scrollback settles it as a fact — a marker can only be there
if *this* paste submitted. Only when it's absent is the send called failed.

> This was filed as a lead on #867, where `memory-manager`'s agent executed zero
> tool calls for two hours while its ~21 KB prompt (a 1,280-byte template plus a
> 19,820-byte audit payload) got 1.0s to render. **The asymmetry is worth fixing
> regardless of whether it turns out to be that hang's cause** — an unattended
> send path that can silently not-send is a latent version of this for every
> scheduled task.
