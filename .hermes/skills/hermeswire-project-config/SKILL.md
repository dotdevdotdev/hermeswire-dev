description: Reference for per-project `.hermeswire.yml` (declarative posture/roles/voice/parent/worktree, agent-writable) and the separate protected `.hermeswire.tasks.yml` (pre/prompt/post/on_task_end/shell/branch-management task schema, authored via propose-and-promote); hierarchical idle notifications with worker summary files and queue processor; role system. Use when configuring a project for hermeswire, wiring up scheduled tasks, defining worker/orchestrator relationships, or debugging task execution.

# `.hermeswire.yml` Project Config

Each project can have a `.hermeswire.yml` in its root directory. This configures posture, roles, voice, and parent for that project.

**Split from task-execution config (#720).** `.hermeswire.yml` is now PURELY
declarative — `posture`/`roles`/`voice`/`parent`/`worktree`, no execution vector —
so it's agent-writable. Named `tasks:` (the code the scheduler actually runs
via `shell=True`: `pre`/`post`/`on_task_end`/`shell`) live in a separate file,
**`.hermeswire.tasks.yml`**, which is protected control-plane. See
[Task Schema](#task-schema-hermeswiretasksyml) below for how to author it.

## Gitignore it (don't commit it)

**`.hermeswire.yml` should be gitignored, not committed.** Two reasons:

1. **A tracked copy breaks worktree dispatch subtly.** Worktree-dispatched runs (scheduler tasks, worktree sessions) check out HEAD — if the file is tracked, uncommitted live edits are invisible to the run, which silently executes the stale committed version. The failure mode is confusing: the live file looks right, the run behaves wrong.
2. **It's personal/live config, not project code.** Voice choices, email recipients, schedules, machine-specific roles — none of that belongs in a repo, especially a public one.

Worktree runs still get the file: `projects.worktrees.copy_files` (default `[".env", ".hermeswire.yml", ".hermeswire.tasks.yml"]`) copies gitignored configs from the main checkout into every new worktree as live files — the live file always wins, no drift.

HermesWire enforces this automatically: whenever it writes `.hermeswire.yml` into a git repo (`hermeswire projects create`, `hermeswire new --persist`, portal project settings), it appends the file to the project's `.gitignore` unless it's already ignored — or already *tracked*. A tracked file is left alone: committing is a valid choice for teams that want shared, versioned task definitions, but they're opting into the HEAD-checkout behavior above — worktree runs use the committed version, never live edits. To switch an existing project to the recommended setup: `git rm --cached .hermeswire.yml`, add it to `.gitignore`, commit. `hermeswire tasks promote` gitignores `.hermeswire.tasks.yml` (via a `.hermeswire.tasks*.yml` glob, covering the staging draft too) the same way, on first promote.

**Format is FLAT (no nesting):**

```yaml
# Session with voice and hermeswire awareness
posture: bypass
roles:
  - hermeswire
  - voice
voice: may
parent: main  # Notify parent session when idle (optional)
```

```yaml
# WRONG - don't nest under "session:"
session:
  posture: bypass
  roles: [...]  # This won't be loaded!
```

| Field | Values | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `posture` | `bypass`, `prompted`, `auto` (or `bare`) | Permission mode the agent runs under. Use `auto` for unattended work — classifier blocks dangerous actions. |
| `roles` | List of role names | Roles to load (from bundled or `~/.hermeswire/roles/`) |
| `voice` | Voice name | TTS voice for this project |
| `parent` | Session name | Parent session for hierarchical notifications |
| `worktree` | `dir` / `base` mapping | Per-project overrides for `hermeswire worktree` (see below) |

`shell`/`tasks` used to live here — they moved to the separate, protected
`.hermeswire.tasks.yml` (#720). See [Task Schema](#task-schema-hermeswiretasksyml).

## Worktree overrides (#705)

A project can override where `hermeswire worktree` puts its worktrees and which
branch they fork from, without touching the global config — the
monorepo/develop-base shop is the canonical case:

```yaml
worktree:
  dir: ~/work-trees     # overrides global worktree.worktree_dir for THIS project
  base: develop         # overrides global worktree.default_base for THIS project
```

Precedence (most specific wins): per-invocation CLI/MCP `--base` flag →
project `.hermeswire.yml` `worktree:` block → global `~/.hermeswire/config.yaml`
`worktree:` → built-ins (`~/worktrees`, repo origin/HEAD). The nesting shape is
unchanged — `dir` only moves the root: `<dir>/<project>/<name>/`. ALL worktree
subcommands (create/list/status/remove/prune) resolve through the same
project-scoped dir, and registry entries record the resolved path, so existing
worktrees survive an override change. Unknown keys in the block warn to stderr
but don't fail.

## Task Schema (`.hermeswire.tasks.yml`)

Tasks are defined in the separate, **protected** `.hermeswire.tasks.yml` for use
with `hermeswire ensure` (#720). It holds every field that's actually code the
scheduler runs via `shell=True` — `shell`/`pre`/`post`/`on_task_end` —
so it sits at the same damage-control tier as `.damagecontrol.yml`: a policed
agent cannot write it directly with Edit/Write/Bash.

**Authoring it — propose-and-promote** (mirrors the worktree → PR → review →
merge model, because task defs ARE executable code):

1. An agent drafts to the **unprotected** staging file
   `.hermeswire.tasks.proposed.yml` with its normal file tools.
2. A human runs `hermeswire tasks review [session]` — prints a diff against the
   live file plus every shell-bearing field the draft would run, and any
   validation issues.
3. The human runs `hermeswire tasks promote [session] [--yes]` — copies the
   vetted draft into the live `.hermeswire.tasks.yml` (hermeswire itself,
   host-trusted, does the write) and deletes the draft.

Both commands are **host-only by design** — and `promote` is **hard-gated**,
not just discouraged: it's not exposed as an MCP tool (an MCP tool that
shelled out to it would bypass the Bash-tool protection entirely — see
[Outbound MCP tool gating](../../docs/wiki/internals/damage-control.md#outbound-mcp-tool-gating-457)),
it's blocked as a Bash command even with `# allow:` or the kill switch off
(`PROTECTED_COMMAND_PATTERNS` in `safety/_core.py`), and the function itself
refuses to run under `HERMESWIRE_UNATTENDED=1` or without a genuine host signal
(a real interactive terminal, or the explicit `HERMESWIRE_ALLOW_TASKS_PROMOTE=1`
opt-in for your own non-interactive script) — `--yes` only skips the
confirmation prompt, it never substitutes for that. Run `promote` from your
own terminal; it cannot be made to run through the agent.

**Migrating legacy inline tasks (#736).** Before #720/#721, tasks lived inline
in `.hermeswire.yml` under a `tasks:` key. That block is now **dead weight** —
the executor (`hermeswire ensure` + the scheduler) reads **only**
`.hermeswire.tasks.yml`, so a project whose tasks never moved fails silently
(`ensure` exits 6, scheduled runs error). There is no runtime fallback by
design. Migrate each affected project once:

1. `hermeswire tasks migrate` — reads the inline `.hermeswire.yml` `tasks:` block
   and stages it to `.hermeswire.tasks.proposed.yml` (never writes the protected
   live file). Refuses to clobber an existing `.hermeswire.tasks.yml`; overwrites
   an existing proposed draft (and says so).
2. `hermeswire tasks review` then `hermeswire tasks promote` — vet and land it.
3. Delete the now-dead `tasks:` block from `.hermeswire.yml`.

`hermeswire doctor` flags any project stuck in this state ("tasks defined in
.hermeswire.yml but never migrated to .hermeswire.tasks.yml — they will NOT run
under ensure/scheduler").

      - id: git.commit                                              # or path-scoped
        paths:
          - ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/
```

**`unattended_allow`** (per-task): when the scheduler dispatches a task headless
(`HERMESWIRE_UNATTENDED=1`), the damage-control hook resolves `ask`-tier commands
by **failing closed** — block + email the owner — unless the matched rule carries
a grant. The built-in grants let a task work, open a PR, and email the owner
(`git.add`/`git.commit`/`git.push`/`gh.pr-create`/`outbound.hermeswire-email` —
the last is a blanket allow, any recipient, #804); list extra rules here to
permit a normally-gated action (deploy, DB write, outbound SMS) for **this task
only**. Blocked actions name the exact rule id (in the email and `hermeswire safety
logs`) so widening is copy-paste. Hard blocks (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`) and
interactive sessions are unaffected.

An entry is either a **bare rule id** (unscoped) or a mapping with **`paths`**
(#914) — "commit under `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`" rather than "commit". Two
things to know:

- **Naming a rule here REPLACES the looser grant** from the global config or the
  built-in defaults, so a scoped entry genuinely narrows. It also binds when the
  entry is malformed (a relative path, an empty `paths`) — otherwise a typo
  would silently inherit the unscoped default.
- **A child session inherits this grant**, scope included, to any depth. That is
  deliberate: a fan-out task's children are what do the committing, so a grant
  that stopped at the parent could not fix a delegating task at all.

`hermeswire tasks review` warns before you promote when a task is specified to
run commands its posture will refuse, or names a rule id that does not exist.
See `docs/wiki/internals/damage-control.md`.

**Built-in variables:**
- `{{ date }}`, `{{ time }}`, `{{ datetime }}` - Current date/time
- `{{ session }}`, `{{ task }}`, `{{ project_root }}` - Task identity
- `{{ attempt }}` - Current attempt number (1-based)
- `{{ status }}`, `{{ summary }}`, `{{ summary_file }}` - After completion
- `{{ output }}` - Captured session output (in post phase)
- `{{ work_branch }}`, `{{ pr_url }}` - Branch/PR after branch management (in post phase)
- `{{ var_name }}` - Pre-command outputs

**Exit codes:** 0=complete, 1=failed, 2=incomplete, 3=lock conflict, 4=pre failure, 5=timeout, 6=session error

## Parent Resolution (prompt routing + notifications)

For prompt routing (#276), a session's parent resolves in this order: **creator recorded at `hermeswire new` time** (session metadata, `--created-by` to override) → **`.hermeswire.yml` `parent:`** → none. Worker panes always route to pane 0 of their own session. Interactive prompts (permission/plan/AskUserQuestion) hitting a child are texted to that parent; answer only via `hermeswire prompts answer` (guarded), never raw send-keys.

## Hierarchical Idle Notifications

When a session goes idle, it notifies up the hierarchy via `hermeswire notify-parent` (text-only, no audio):

```
parent session ← receives "[ALERT from child] ..."
    ↑ notify-parent --to parent
child session   ← receives "[ALERT from pane N] ..."
    ↑ auto-notify pane 0
worker panes
```

**Worker summary files:**
- Workers write summaries to `.hermeswire/worker-{pane}.md` before going idle
- Summaries include: task, status, what worked, what didn't, notes for orchestrator
- Orchestrators read these files to understand worker results

**Auto-exit (workers auto-kill on idle):**
- Worker panes (index > 0) automatically exit when idle
- Use `parent: <session-name>` in `.hermeswire.yml` for child → parent notifications

**Queue system files:**
- `~/.hermeswire/queue-processor.sh` - Processes queue with 15s delays between alerts
- `~/.hermeswire/queues/{session}.jsonl` - Per-session notification queues

**Worker idle sequence:**
1. `session.idle` fires → wait 2s (let agent settle)
2. Worker writes summary to `.hermeswire/worker-{pane}.md`
3. Queue notification to `{session}.jsonl`
4. Start queue processor if not running
5. Worker auto-exits

**Idle notifications** are handled via `~/.claude/hooks/idle-handler.sh`.

**Creating a project with roles:**

```bash
# Option 1: Create .hermeswire.yml first, then create session
echo "posture: bypass
roles:
  - hermeswire
  - voice" > ~/projects/myproject/.hermeswire.yml

hermeswire new -s myproject -p ~/projects/myproject

# Option 2: Specify roles on command line, --persist saves to .hermeswire.yml
hermeswire new -s myproject -p ~/projects/myproject --roles hermeswire,voice --persist
```

By default, `hermeswire new` flags (`--posture`, `--roles`) are session-level overrides only and never save to `.hermeswire.yml`. Use `--persist` to opt in to saving.

## Role System

Roles define agent behavior and are composable. Mix and match roles in `.hermeswire.yml` to configure orchestrators, workers, or specialized agents.

**ROLE vs TOPOLOGY (#716, #827):** the session `kind` (`orchestrator` | `worker` | `reviewer`) is a pure authority/etiquette axis — it says nothing about WHERE the session runs. TOPOLOGY (main checkout / worktree branch / pane) is separate and independent. `worker`'s and `reviewer`'s intrinsic etiquette FILE still varies by topology, though: a worktree-topology worker gets `worker-worktree` (isolation, draft-PR, notify, keeps voice), a pane/main-topology worker gets `worker` (headless, exit-summary, auto-kill); a worktree-topology reviewer gets `reviewer-worktree` (isolation, pulls the sibling's branch in for local e2e, keeps voice), a pane/main-topology reviewer gets `reviewer` (headless). Neither is user-selectable directly — they're resolved from `kind` + topology by `resolve_roles`.

**Available roles:**

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `hermeswire` | Core session/pane/MCP tools awareness |
| `orchestrator` | Long-lived project orchestrator — plans, delegates, reviews results. Topology-invariant (same role file on main or a worktree). |
| `voice` | Voice communication (speak/listen) |
| `worker` | Receive tasks, execute autonomously, report back. Intrinsic etiquette for a pane (`hermeswire spawn`) or a main-topology session — headless, exit-summary, auto-kill. Not directly selectable via `--roles` as a *replacement* for the worktree flavor; it's resolved from kind + topology. |
| `worker-worktree` | Intrinsic etiquette for `hermeswire worktree` sessions (isolation, no rebuild/restart, verify in-worktree, draft PR + notify-back, keeps voice) — auto-injected when kind=worker on worktree topology, not configurable |
| `reviewer` | Adversarially reviews a sibling session's PR — never opens/merges its own PR, never patches the branch under review. Headless pane/main-topology default; safety-rail (non-overridable, like `worker`). |
| `reviewer-worktree` | Intrinsic etiquette for `hermeswire worktree --kind reviewer` (isolation, pull the sibling's branch in for local e2e, never push/PR/merge, keeps voice) — auto-injected when kind=reviewer on worktree topology, not configurable |
| `task-runner` | Scheduled task execution |
| `chatbot` | Conversational personality |
| `init` | Setup wizard behavior |

Use `hermeswire roles list` to see available roles. Roles are bundled in `hermeswire/roles/` and can be composed freely in `.hermeswire.yml`.
