# HermesWire Config (`~/.hermeswire/config.yaml`)

## Layout of `~/.hermeswire/`

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.yaml` | Main config (see structure below) |
| `machines.json` | Remote machines registry |
| `scripts/` | Machine-specific helper scripts (TTS management, startup, etc.) |
| `voices/` | Custom TTS voice samples |
| `uploads/` | Uploaded images for cross-machine sharing |
| `artifacts/` | Agent-generated HTML for artifact windows |
| `wiki/` | LLM-maintained knowledge base (Karpathy LLM Wiki pattern) |
| `logs/` | Audit logs for damage-control |

Per-session config (posture, roles, voice) lives in `.hermeswire.yml` in each project directory (see `hermeswire-project-config` skill).

## Machine Scripts (`~/.hermeswire/scripts/`)

Each machine has a `~/.hermeswire/scripts/` directory for machine-specific helper scripts (TTS management, startup hooks, service wrappers, etc.). This is the standard location — agents should look here first and put new scripts here.

Scripts in `~/bin/` should symlink to `~/.hermeswire/scripts/` so they're callable from PATH but the source of truth is in one place.

These scripts are **not** managed by hermeswire — they're local to each machine and not version controlled. They exist because different machines have different roles (GPU server runs TTS, Mac runs the portal, etc.) and need different glue scripts.

## config.yaml Structure

```yaml
server:
  host: "127.0.0.1"  # default; "0.0.0.0" allows LAN/phone access and requires the auth token (see SECURITY.md)
  port: 8765
  activity_threshold_seconds: 3  # Seconds before session considered idle
  ssl:
    cert: "~/.hermeswire/cert.pem"
    key: "~/.hermeswire/key.pem"
  # Auth token: unset = use ~/.hermeswire/portal.token (auto-generated on first
  # non-loopback start; print/rotate with `hermeswire portal token [--rotate]`).
  # Set a string to override the file; "" disables auth (loopback binds only —
  # the portal refuses to start on 0.0.0.0 with auth disabled).
  # auth_token: ""
  # Extra browser origins allowed on state-changing requests (exact
  # scheme://host[:port]). The portal's own origin and localhost always pass.
  # Needed when fronting with Cloudflare Tunnel:
  allowed_origins: []  # e.g. ["https://portal.example.com"]

                           #  so .env/secrets/local config don't carry over —
                           #  add ".env.local", ".envrc", etc. as needed).
                           # Keep .hermeswire.yml/.hermeswire.tasks.yml gitignored: a TRACKED
                           # copy means worktree runs use the committed version (HEAD) and
                           # silently ignore live edits — see hermeswire-project-config skill.

                                  # Omit → branch == name verbatim. Only the git branch is

session:
  # No global default-role: a session's ROLE is derived from its spawn verb
  # (new → orchestrator or worker depending on branch, worktree → worker by
  # default, spawn → worker), then any --roles / .hermeswire.yml roles: stack
  # on (worker) or replace (orchestrator) it. TOPOLOGY (worktree vs pane/main)
  # separately picks WHICH worker etiquette file (worker-worktree vs worker).
  # See resolve_roles.
  inject_soul: true          # Append the bundled 'soul' personality role to every human-facing
                             # session (appended last for recency weight). Headless roles
                             # (worker, task-runner, notifications) and soul/soul-* sessions
                             # are excluded automatically; per-session opt-out: --no-soul on new/dev

beta:
  # Opt-in gates for features that SHIP on main but stay off until asked for.
  # Every flag defaults to false, and "off" means ABSENT — not merely dormant:
  # a gated feature's role-prompt lines AND its MCP tool-description prose are
  # stripped before a model sees them, so a user who never enabled it pays no
  # tokens for it. Only a real YAML boolean turns one on — `voice_layer: "false"`
  # (quoted) stays OFF, deliberately. `hermeswire doctor` reports each flag's
  # state either way. Config-only (no CLI verb); env override works via
  # HERMESWIRE_BETA__VOICE_LAYER=true.
  voice_layer: false         # The realtime voice buddy (`hermeswire buddy`). Off: every buddy
                             # subcommand refuses, naming this key and OPENAI_API_KEY (which
                             # lives in ~/.hermeswire/.env). See docs/wiki/voice-layer.md §0.
```

## Custom Command-Palette Items (`palette:`) (#676)

User-defined portal Cmd/Ctrl+K entries — personal CLI workflows reachable from the palette without editing source. Local-only host config (like `~/.hermeswire/scripts/`), and execution-plane: `palette.` can never be added to the `hermeswire config set` allowlist.

```yaml
palette:
  items:
    - id: quicktask                 # [A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]* — unique
      label: "Quick task"           # shown in the palette
      icon: "⚡"                    # optional (default ⚡)
      keywords: "quicktask worktree"  # optional extra search terms
      run: "hermeswire worktree {name} -p {project}"  # shell command template
      fields:                       # optional — opens a mini-form before running
        - { name: name,    label: "Branch/task name" }
        - { name: project, label: "Project", default: "hermeswire-dev" }
```

- Every `{placeholder}` in `run` must be a declared field; field *values* are shell-quoted at run time (no injection via the form), while the template itself is trusted owner config.
- No `fields` → the item runs immediately on selection; output lands as a portal toast.
- CLI: `hermeswire palette list [--json]`, `hermeswire palette run <id> --field k=v` (300s timeout). Portal wraps these via `GET /api/palette` + `POST /api/palette/run`.
