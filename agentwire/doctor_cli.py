"""CLI for diagnostics — ``agentwire doctor`` and ``agentwire network``.

``doctor`` walks the full install (Python/deps, hooks, skills, damage control,
source-checkout drift, services, config, SSH/tunnels, voice loop, secrets,
remote machines, dead-lettered messages, dangling worktree sessions) and
optionally auto-fixes the local ones. ``network status`` is the read-only
network-health glance.

The hook/skill drift helpers (``get_hooks_source``, ``_managed_hook_files``,
``_managed_file_state``, ``skill_drift``, ``CLAUDE_SKILLS_DIR``) are owned by
the hooks domain and live in ``hooks_cli``; doctor reads them via a
function-local deferred import to stay single-source-of-truth.

def scan_orphaned_history(sessions: list[str] | None = None) -> list[dict]:
    """Recorded sessions whose conversation is intact but unreachable (#871).

    Claude keys conversation history by cwd (``~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/``),
    so a session whose directory MOVED has a transcript that still exists and
    can no longer be found: ``--resume`` from the new location reports
    ``No conversation found with session ID``. That is a distinct state from
    "history gone", and only this one is recoverable — by migrating the
    history dir alongside the worktree.

    Two ways in, one rule. The key we compare against is where the session
    RUNS: its live pane cwd when it's up (that's what a moved directory
    changes, and tmux is the authority on it — the same ask-don't-assume rule
    #837 put on worktree paths), else the recorded ``cwd_at_launch``.

    **This SURVEYS the whole chain; ``restart`` stops at the first hit.** They
    share ``history.locate_conversation`` — one predicate — but they are asking
    different questions, and collapsing them was a real bug: restart wants
    "the newest resumable id" (first match wins, correct for it), and the
    moment a restart created a fresh conversation with a transcript, an older
    orphaned link became unreachable to a first-match scan. Doctor went quiet
    one turn after the restart, with both orphaned transcripts still on disk —
    silence for exactly the user who did the natural thing. So every link in
    ``conversation_ids`` is probed here, and any orphan among them is reported
    whether or not a later link resumes.

    Returns both non-resumable states, tagged by ``status``, because only one
    of them is a fault:

    - ``orphaned`` — the fault. Reported and counted. ``current`` says whether
      the session's newest conversation is the affected one (nothing resumes)
      or whether it is an earlier link (the session works; stranded history is
      sitting next to it).
    - ``gone`` — no history anywhere, and this cannot say WHY: a session that
      was never prompted has no transcript because none was ever written
      (lazy creation), and Claude also evicts from its own cache
      (``~/.claude/projects/`` was observed dropping 563 -> 544 in ~25min with
      ``cleanupPeriodDays`` unset, cause undetermined). Reported for LIVE
      sessions only, as information, never as an issue — a live session is one
      you might actually restart, whereas counting every dead record would
      flag hundreds of them, most of which nobody will ever relaunch.
