    ``import agentwire.mcp_msg`` from 4.8ms to 83ms. The gate sits on hot paths
    (every role file at session launch, an MCP tool description at import) and
    must cost about what reading one small YAML file costs.

    It is not a second source of truth: the parse is the same function
    ``_dict_to_config`` calls, and env overrides run through the same
    ``_apply_env_overrides``, so ``AGENTWIRE_BETA__VOICE_LAYER=true`` behaves
    identically on both paths.
