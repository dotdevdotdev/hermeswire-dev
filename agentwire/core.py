    the agent launches and the damage-control hook can read it.

    THE TWO VARS INHERIT DIFFERENTLY AND THAT IS DELIBERATE (#914). A child
    session an unattended agent spawns inherits BOTH — transitively, to any
    depth, and across projects (``created_by`` is dropped for a cross-project
    spawn, #715; this env is not rooted). For ``AGENTWIRE_UNATTENDED`` that is
    defense in depth: it TIGHTENS, so inheriting it can only ever block more.
    ``AGENTWIRE_UNATTENDED_ALLOW`` inherits on the same path and LOOSENS, which
    is a materially different thing and went undocumented until #914.

    It is kept, deliberately: the motivating fan-out task (``memory-manager``)
    does not act itself — it spawns four children that do, so a grant that
    stopped at the parent could not fix a delegating task at all, and that gap
    applies to every task that delegates. What makes the inheritance safe is
    that the grant now carries its PATH SCOPE with it (``encode_unattended_allow``
    keeps the scope in the wire format), so what a child inherits is
    "commit under ``<store>``", not "commit". A child cannot widen it: the
    damage-control hook reads this var from the Claude Code process env, not
    from the shell the agent runs commands in, and the files that define grants
    are protected control plane.

    The counterpart to the recorded ``cwd_at_launch``: asked of the running

    compared. They diverge exactly when someone relocates a session's
    directory — which is what strands its Claude history under the old key
    (#871 item 5). Returns None when the session isn't live.

    **The agent pane is the FIRST pane, resolved by asking, never by index.**
    Three measured facts force that (all on real tmux, and the first is what
    this function originally got wrong):

    - ``display-message -t "=<session>"`` returns an EMPTY string. A session
      target does not resolve a pane-level format, so the helper answered None
      for every session alive and the check built on it was inert.
    - ``display-message`` does not fail on an unresolvable target either — it
      silently returns the ACTIVE pane. ``-t "=<session>:9.9"`` came back rc=0
      with a plausible path. So a hardcoded index that is wrong doesn't error,
      it lies. ``list-panes`` exits 1 with "can't find window" instead.
    - Indices are not knowable in advance. ``base-index`` and
      ``pane-base-index`` are independent options a ``.tmux.conf`` can set
      either way, and existing windows keep their old index when it changes —
      this machine currently has live sessions at window 1 *and* window 0.

    ``-s`` is load-bearing: without it ``list-panes`` scopes to the session's
    ACTIVE WINDOW, so a session with a second window open (a worker split, an
    artifact window, an operator poking around) answers with the wrong pane.
    With it, panes come back in index order, so line one is the lowest
    window/pane under any base — which is also why an active worker pane can't
    make its orchestrator look moved.

    """Record a session's launch identity — the ONE writer of metadata.json (#871).

    Every path that starts an agent in a tmux SESSION calls this exactly once,
    right after the launch: ``new`` (and therefore ``worktree`` /
    ``orchestrator`` / scheduler+ensure dispatch, which all delegate to it),
    ``recreate``, ``fork``, ``history resume``, and ``dev``. Routing them all
    through one function is the point: a creation path that hand-rolls its own
    record is exactly how the worktree-path (#837) and session-name (#868)
    conventions each drifted into a bug that reported success while doing
    nothing.

    Deliberately NOT called by ``spawn`` — a worker pane is not a session, and
    this store is keyed by session name, so a pane recording here would
    overwrite its OWNING session's record. Panes still get a durable role
    prompt from ``build_agent_command``; they just have nowhere
    session-scoped to write it.

    What comes from where:

    - ``agent`` supplies the Hermes session id, role-prompt path, posture and
      role names — the flag builder is the only thing that knows them, and
      taking the whole object means a caller can't pair them wrong.
    - ``cwd`` supplies ``cwd_at_launch`` verbatim plus the git-derived
      repo/branch/worktree triple. ``remote=True`` records the path but skips
      the git derivation — the path lives on another machine, and a same-named
      local directory would otherwise answer with some other repo's branch.
    - ``roles`` + ``posture`` are recorded to REGENERATE the system prompt,
      not merely to reference it — a role-prompt file that has gone missing
      is recoverable from them.

    Session identity under Hermes (#4): ``conversation_ids`` holds Hermes
    session ids, not minted UUIDs. ``--resume <id>`` continues the SAME
    session, so a resume launch appends nothing new (its id is already in the
    chain); the chain only grows when Hermes itself forks/compresses a session
    into a new id (``parent_session_id``), captured post-launch. ``source`` is
    recorded as ``"tool"`` and ``resumed_from`` as the id this launch resumed.

    A write that fails is WARNED about, never raised (#885): by the time this
    runs the session is already live in tmux, so a traceback here would turn a
    successful creation into a failed command while leaving the session
    running. Silence was the actual bug — the warning names the session, the
    session id that is now unrecoverable, and what breaks because of it.
