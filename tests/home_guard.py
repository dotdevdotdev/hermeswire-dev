"""Detection half of the real-``~/.hermeswire`` protection (#893).

Lives in its own module rather than in ``conftest.py`` for a reason that bit
this guard during development: pytest loads the root conftest as the top-level
module ``conftest``, while a test doing ``import tests.conftest`` gets a
*second, distinct* module object. Both copies then ran the installer, so two
audit hooks recorded every write, and a flag set on one copy did not silence
the other — the guard's own tests were suppressing one recorder while the other
kept failing the run.

That is the same second-copy-of-the-SSOT shape as #899, arriving by a different
route. One owning module, imported by absolute name from both sides, is the
fix: ``tests.home_guard`` resolves to a single object however conftest was
loaded.
