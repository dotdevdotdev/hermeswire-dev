"""Unit tests for tmux-legal session-name derivation (#868, #878).

tmux rewrites its address separators in session names, so every creation path
maps them to ``_``. Resolution used the project directory's name RAW, so for
any project whose directory contains a dot (``~/.claude``,
``~/projects/dotdev.dev``) teardown derived a name no session could ever have —
matched nothing, and said it had removed one anyway. Same class as #855 on the
session-name axis. ``:`` is the second separator and had the identical hole
(#878); ``TestTmuxRewriteSet`` pins the complete set so this stops recurring.
