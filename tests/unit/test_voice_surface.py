"""#966: the tier audit, the declared-write mechanism, and the expanded reads.

Three properties, each asserted structurally rather than by inspection:

1. **The audit cannot drift.** Every ``@mcp.tool`` name in ``hermeswire/mcp_*.py``
   must appear in exactly one tier in ``voice_layer.surface`` — parsed from the
   source at test time, so a new MCP tool fails this file until someone places
   it, and a removed one fails until its tier entry goes too.
2. **Tier 3 is unreachable BY NAME.** The harness boundary (#730) and the
   other exclusion clauses are asserted against the live realtime surface, not
   established by reading the diff.
3. **A write is a declaration.** ``gated_triple`` turns a :class:`WriteSpec`
   into a working propose/confirm/cancel path with the spine's invariants —
   proven here with a spec that exists only in this test, including the
   argv-only (``append_body=False``) shape no shipped spec uses yet.

    r"""Every ``@mcp.tool`` name in ``hermeswire/mcp_*.py``.

    Delegates to :func:`mcp_tool_defs` rather than running its own regex, and
    that consolidation is a bug fix rather than tidying. The regex it replaced
    was ``@mcp\.tool\([^)]*\)\s*\ndef\s+(\w+)`` — it required the ``def``
    to be the NEXT line, so a tool wearing a second decorator became invisible
    to the audit. It went unnoticed because nothing here stacked one until the
    beta gate did (``@mcp.tool()`` / ``@gated_doc`` / ``def msg_send``), and
    the direction that hid it is the dangerous one: a tool the audit cannot
    see is a tool nobody is required to place in a tier.

    **Scope of the regex era, measured, so nobody re-opens it as a shipped
    gap:** it missed ZERO tools on ``origin/main``, zero on the spine base and
    zero before a stacked decorator existed — one tool (``msg_send``), in one
    tree, introduced and fixed in the same change.

    **Recorded limitation, deliberately not fixed:** this walks the parsed
    module's TOP-LEVEL body, so a tool defined inside a function or an ``if``
    block is invisible to it. Neither shape exists in the package today, and
    both are worth catching if one ever lands — a conditionally-defined tool is
    exactly the kind that would want a tier ruling most.
