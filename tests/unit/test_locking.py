# --- Dead-holder recovery race regression (#491) -------------------------------
#
# The waiter path used to unlink a lock file whenever it observed a dead holder
# PID, without re-checking the lock was still unheld. The dangerous state is a
# *live* holder whose lock file happens to record a dead PID — which occurs
# transiently every time a process acquires the flock but hasn't yet written its
# own PID over the previous (now-dead) holder's. A waiter that reads that dead
# PID would unlink the live holder's file and re-acquire on a fresh inode, so
# both processes end up "holding" the lock on different inodes — mutual
# exclusion broken. The fix relies on flock's kernel-level auto-release on
# holder death: recovery happens purely by re-acquiring the flock (which proves
# the prior holder is gone), never by unlinking based on a separately-read PID.
#
# Worker functions are module-level so multiprocessing ("spawn") can pickle them.
