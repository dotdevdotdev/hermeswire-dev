"""Deployment correctness for the damage-control heal (#936 + #916).

``heal_damage_control`` is one function that failed in opposite directions:

* **hook scripts** — ``shutil.copy2`` on ANY difference, with no ordering, from
  ``Path(__file__).parent``. A session on a stale branch reinstalled a pre-fix
  security hook machine-wide, and ``copy2`` preserved the source mtime so the
  downgrade looked older than the deployment it replaced (#936).
* **rules / tooldefs** — ``if not target.exists()``, so an existing file was
  never updated by any command, ever. Every rule fix this repo ships was inert
  on every existing install (#916).

The acceptance bar these tests are written to: *a deployment claim must name the
path that EXECUTES*. So the end-to-end case drives the INSTALLED hook script as
a subprocess and reads the rule id out of the audit record that hook wrote —
not ``heal_damage_control`` returning a happy summary, which is the bug.
