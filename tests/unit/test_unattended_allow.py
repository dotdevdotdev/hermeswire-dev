"""The unattended allowlist grants an OPERATION and shadows no hard block (#925).

Two rules of engagement govern every assertion here.

**Name the rule set you measured.** ``_load`` builds from BUNDLED rules +
BUNDLED tooldefs explicitly and asserts the pattern and anchored counts at load
time. A bare interpreter without pyyaml makes ``load_config`` return empty, at
which point every command reads ALLOW and a green run proves nothing — the
count assertion turns that into a crash instead of a nicer-looking number. The
live copies under ``~/.hermeswire/`` are neither loaded nor consulted; they drift
(measured 2026-08-06: bundled 265/101, live 225/87) and tuning against
semantics that do not ship is how a fix lands backwards.

**Assert the rule ID, not the verdict.** ``uv run git push --force`` reads
BLOCK both before and after this change, so a verdict-only test passes either
way. What actually decides whether the allowlist opens a hole is *which id came
back*: rules are evaluated in order and the first match returns, so an earlier
``ask`` rule can hide a later ``block``, and the unattended resolver then turns
that hidden block into a permit. Every case below pins the id.
