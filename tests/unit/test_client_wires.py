"""The remaining unpinned browser-event wires in ``client.py`` (#995).

#995's shape: a single line wires a browser event to a code path, and nothing
asserts the wire exists. The tests that look like they cover it assert a
parameter name in a signature, or assert the downstream function behaves —
never that the event handler calls it. Cut the line and the whole suite stays
green.

#993 closed two instances (``utterance.onerror`` / ``utterance.onend``) and
#1001 closed the worst one (``pc.ontrack`` → ``maybeGreet()``, pinned in
``test_buddy_restart.py``). Four were left, and they are what this file pins:

    client.py  dc.addEventListener("open",  …)   status → "listening", stop enabled
    client.py  dc.addEventListener("close", …)   status → "closed"
    client.py  $start.addEventListener("click", start)
    client.py  $stop.addEventListener("click", stop)

Same technique as ``test_buddy_restart.py``, and deliberately the SAME
extractor (:func:`tests.page_slice.page_slice`) rather than a second idiom —
including its guard against a partial anchor match, which otherwise degrades
to an opaque node ``SyntaxError`` instead of saying "the anchor moved".

Why these two pairs are worth a node run rather than a substring assertion.
The substring half is here too (``TestTheWiresArePresentAtAll``) and it is what
gives the honest message when a whole line is deleted — but a substring cannot
tell ``("click", start)`` from ``("click", stop)``, and it cannot tell a status
wire that fires from one that sets the wrong thing. Both of those are live
mutations: the start/stop pair is the owner's only entry and exit point, and a
swapped pair makes the page unusable while every existing test stays green.

What this does NOT establish: that the browser ever fires these events. That
half is not in reach of a unit harness and is not what #995 is about — the
claim under test is that the page WIRES them, which is exactly what a mutation
can silently remove.

#: The shape each dc status wire must still have, and it is doing more work
#: than it looks. The end anchor is "the first ``;`` at end of line", which a
#: reflowed handler — formatting only, wire intact — satisfies at the FIRST
#: statement of the body, yielding a syntactically broken fragment. A loose
#: shape (``=>[\s\S]*\);``) matches that fragment, because the ``);`` of the
#: truncated call inside it stands in for the listener's own. The reader then
#: gets an opaque node ``SyntaxError`` instead of "the anchor moved" — which is
#: the exact degradation #995 names by name, reproduced by the test written to
#: close it.
#:
#: So the shape demands the arrow function's own terminator: either a BALANCED
#: brace body with nothing nested (``{[^{}]*}``) or a single expression with no
#: statement break in it, and then the call's ``);``. A truncated fragment has
#: neither. Still invariant under the mutations these tests exist to catch — an
#: emptied body is ``{}``, which matches — so a cut wire fails as a behaviour
#: failure and never as a stale-anchor one.
