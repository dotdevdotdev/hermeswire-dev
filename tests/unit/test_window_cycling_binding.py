"""Guard the #696 window-cycling keyboard contract in the portal static JS.

Owner decision on #696: Tab and Shift+Tab are NEVER intercepted by the desktop
(Claude Code needs Tab for completion and Shift+Tab for permission modes, #659);
window cycling lives on a dedicated unconditional Alt+] / Alt+[ chord instead.
There is no JS test runner in this repo, so these are source-level assertions
tying desktop.js's real binding to the shortcuts.js catalogue that feeds the
F1 help modal (the two must stay in sync — see shortcuts.js header).
