"""The suite must never write into the real ~/.hermeswire (#893).

This is the regression pin for a defect found by accident: the record at
``~/.hermeswire/sessions/resumed/metadata.json`` was written by the test suite
and had grown to 80 fabricated conversation ids, one chain entry per full-suite
run. It was not merely untidy — it corrupted a measurement. Sizing #871's
orphaned-history doctor check against the real store showed 28 recorded ids
with no transcript, and every one of them came from that single polluted
record. Genuinely orphaned: zero. A threshold calibrated on that would have
been tuned entirely against noise the tests invented.

These tests exercise the writers directly rather than asserting on the store's
current contents, so they stay meaningful after the stale record is deleted.

    only for ``builtins.open``/``io.open``, while the low-level ``os.open``
    passes ``mode=None`` and carries the intent in ``flags``. The first version
    checked only ``mode``, so it returned before recording — blind to
    ``os.open`` entirely.

    That is not a corner case. ``os.open`` is how seven production sites create
    files under the config dir, including ``core.write_role_prompt``, which
    uses it precisely so the prompt is never briefly world-readable. One miss
    in the mode check silently disabled detection for all of them.
