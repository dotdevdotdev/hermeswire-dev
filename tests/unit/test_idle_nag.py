"""Unit tests for the edge-triggered idle-nag decision helper (#464).

`should_nag_idle_session` is a pure function: it decides whether an idle
session should be included in the nag batch this scan, given its current
`last_output_timestamp` and the timestamp captured at its last nag. These
tests exercise it without the async loop / tmux.
