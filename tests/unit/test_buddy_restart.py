"""Restart semantics for the supervised buddy bridge (#983).

The lifecycle-host wave puts the bridge under a supervisor, which means the
question "what does a restart mid-handshake land in?" stops being hypothetical:
the watchdog can kill and respawn the process at any point, including between a
proposal being anchored and its spoken nonce arriving.

The issue said this is clean "by construction". It is — the confirm spine and
the utterance ring are per-``BuddyBridge`` and nothing in ``confirm.py`` or
``transcript.py`` touches disk — but *by construction* is a claim about code
that is one refactor away from being false, and nothing failed when it became
false. So it is pinned two ways here: the objects a second ``serve()`` hands
out are empty, AND nothing the first run proposed exists anywhere under
``~/.hermeswire`` afterwards. The second assertion is the one that survives
someone deciding proposals should be durable.

The acceptance test the issue names is the greet: after a supervised restart,
the next "Start talking" must greet, because a heard greeting is what proves
the write path can approve anything at all (#950/#963). #995 records that the
wires arming that greet — ``pc.ontrack`` among them — have no pin at all and
can be cut with the whole suite staying green. They are executed here, as
themselves, extracted from the page the server actually serves.
