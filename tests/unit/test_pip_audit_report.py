"""A red pip-audit must not render as green (#900).

The fixture here is the REAL failing state: ``EIGHT_FINDINGS`` is the exact set
pip-audit reported against the lockfile on ``main``, package/version/advisory
id/fix-version as published. Every "does it surface?" test runs against that,
not against a hand-made single finding — because the whole bug being fixed is
that eight real advisories were invisible, and a report tool proven only on a
toy input proves nothing about the day it matters.

The last class is the one that would have caught this class of bug at review
time: it asserts the workflow YAML actually WIRES the script in, and that the
job is still non-blocking. A perfectly-tested reporter that nothing calls is
exactly the failure mode #900 is about.
