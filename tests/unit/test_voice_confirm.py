"""Tests for the voice layer's confirm spine (Slice 1, branch-only).

**Proved by mutation, not by the passing case.** A gate exercised only with a
valid approval proves nothing — the load-bearing assertion is always that
something FAILS TO WRITE. Every refusal below asserts on a runner that was never
called, not merely on a falsy return: "returned success=False" and "did not run
the command" are different claims, and only the second is the guarantee.

The mandated mutations (spec v2 §8) are in :class:`TestGateRefusals`, one test
each: no prior proposal, expired TTL, replay *after success*, wrong/absent
nonce, an approval whose item-commit time predates the proposal's anchor, a
Whisper-class silence hallucination, an approval followed by a denial, and one
approval offered to two outstanding proposals.

Two things this file deliberately does NOT try to prove, because asserting them
here would be fixture-shaped:

- **That a refusal is actually spoken.** A Python return value says nothing
  about whether audio happened, and is green in exactly the scenario the
  requirement exists to prevent. That assertion lives in
  ``test_voice_announcer.py``, against the data channel.
- **That the rendered body survives delivery.** That is measured against the
  real paste path in ``test_voice_body_delivery.py``.

Deliberately in-process. Shelling ``hermeswire msg send`` with prose about
guarded operations through the Bash tool trips the damage-control hook (#915),
and the interesting cases here contain exactly such prose. Nothing here disables
a guard; the runner is injected rather than stubbed at the subprocess layer.
