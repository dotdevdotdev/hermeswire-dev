"""Process ("command") custom services, and doctor's reporting leg (#983).

A custom service used to be one thing: an hermeswire agent session. The voice
buddy's bridge is not that — it is a plain long-running process — and until it
had somewhere to live it was hand-launched, which means it survived no reboot
and appeared in no diagnostic.

These pin the generic half of that: what a `command:` entry parses to, that it
is supervised by tmux rather than by `hermeswire new`, that its output lands on
no world-readable surface, and that doctor reports it beside the agent
services. Nothing here knows what the process is — the buddy is one caller of a
mechanism that has no idea it exists.
