"""The logical clock's ORIGIN is server-owned (#978 blocking 1).

The confirm gate orders on a logical clock the CLIENT assigns (``nextSeq``),
because the client is the only place that sees data-channel event order. What
the client cannot supply is the clock's **origin**: ``seqCounter`` is a page
variable and starts at 0 on every page load, while the ring and the spine live
for the whole bridge run.

So a reload put the two out of step in the one direction that matters. The
pre-reload utterances sit in the ring at high sequences, complete and unspent;
the fresh page anchors its next proposal at 1. ``ring.after(anchor)`` then
returns LAST session's utterances, and two things follow, both fail-closed and
both persistently wrong in a channel with no screen:

1. they reach ``_judge`` as non-matching, so the proposal burns attempts toward
   ``too_many_attempts`` for a question the owner was never asked;
2. worse, the post-approval denial scan sees an old "no, hang on" as strictly
   AFTER the new match and retroactively denies every legitimate approval,
   until 32 fresh utterances evict it from the ring.

The fix is the second of the two directions #978 named — **move the clock's
origin server-side**. ``/mint`` is the one event that happens exactly once per
page load, so the bridge answers it with a sequence base above every sequence
it has ever seen, and the page starts counting from there. Nothing is rejected
and nothing is deleted: the false-reject half of a rejecting epoch guard is a
dropped utterance, which in this channel is a silent loop, and it would be paid
on the owner's LIVE tab.

The base is advanced by a whole :data:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.server.MINT_SEQ_GAP`
rather than by one, which is what makes it an epoch rather than a bump: two
tabs minting against one bridge get non-overlapping numeric ranges, so tab A
would have to emit a million events before it could reach into tab B's.

Two properties of that base are load-bearing and are tested here rather than
assumed, both found in review:

- it is **reserved atomically** (``reserve_epoch``, one lock). Read-then-write
  is two acquisitions, and two concurrent mints on the bridge's threading
  server can be handed the same base — the two-interleaved-counters case, back
  inside the fix for it.
- it is **bounded** (:data:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.server.MAX_SEQ`). The number
  now crosses into the page's counter, where it is a double rather than an
  int: past 2**53 an increment stops advancing and every event shares a
  sequence, and past that it is ``Infinity``, whose anchors serialize as
  ``null``. Both wedge the buddy silently for the rest of the bridge run.
