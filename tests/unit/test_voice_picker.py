"""Voice selection: enumeration, the live picker, and register-vs-update (#1017).

Three paper cuts from the first live session, and what they have in common is
that each one is invisible from inside the code — they are only defects if you
are the owner, on a phone, with no screen to read:

1. ``--voice`` took any string. A typo produced a bridge that connects and then
   sounds like nothing, which is indistinguishable from a dead mic.
2. Changing voice meant Ctrl-C, re-serve, reload. Ten values, three steps.
3. ``register --voice`` on an existing buddy re-printed the whole registration
   blurb, which reads like a second identity was created.

The pins below are chosen so a regression fails as a BEHAVIOUR failure: the
enumeration is read out of :data:`realtime.VOICES` wherever it is asserted (a
second literal list in a test is the drift it exists to catch), and the picker's
wire is executed as itself, extracted from the page the server actually serves
— the #995 rule that a wire nothing runs can be cut with the suite still green.
