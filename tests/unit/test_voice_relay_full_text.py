"""The FULL relayed utterance reaches the recipient (#1015).

The measured failure: every relay in the first live voice session arrived cut
off mid-sentence (``"Treat it as a running list for anyt…"``) and the receiving
session acted on the fragment. The body's caps are not raisable — they are the
measured #689 boundary — so the fix is a second channel: the whole request on
disk, a pointer to it on the delivered line, and the inline text demoted to a
preview.

What each test here is worth is stated as the failure it would let through, not
as "the pointer is present": a pointer that names a file that was never written,
or that a budget squeeze dropped, or that a spine-level path never actually
freezes into the argv, all leave the owner exactly where #1015 found them —
with a session acting on half a sentence.
