"""Bypass-resistance regression corpus for the damage-control matcher.

Loads the REAL bundled rule YAMLs (``hermeswire/hooks/damage-control/rules``) — not
synthetic inline patterns — and asserts two things at once:

  * a corpus of known evasion vectors (quoting/escaping, ``$VAR`` indirection,
    command substitution, tilde/``$HOME`` secret reads, non-``rm`` deletion) is
    BLOCKed or ASKed, and
  * a corpus of common, safe everyday commands (the kind agents run constantly,
    including the #492 ``.env`` false positives) still PASSes.

A safety layer that cries wolf gets turned off, so the false-positive corpus is
as load-bearing as the bypass corpus. Both must stay green.

# This corpus asserts on ``~``-form secret paths (``cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa``), so it
# needs ``$HOME`` to look like a real home. The #893 redirect points HOME at a
# pytest tmp dir, and on Linux that is under ``/tmp`` — which ``core.yaml``
# allowlists ``allow: all``. An allowlist entry outranks ``zeroAccessPaths``, so
# the tilde vectors resolved to ``allow`` and the corpus went green-to-red for a
# reason that had nothing to do with the matcher. (macOS temp is
# ``/private/var/folders``, which is not allowlisted — hence it only showed up
# on CI.) Reads only; the audit backstop still catches any write.
