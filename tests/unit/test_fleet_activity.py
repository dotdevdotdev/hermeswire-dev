"""The fleet's own signals reach the buddy — and the ruling on which ones SPEAK (#1016).

Same two-directional shape as ``test_fleet_alerts``, because this producer has
the same two ways to be wrong and they are not equally cheap:

* **The false-REJECT half** — the state before this module. The idle handler,
  the notify family and the scheduler all knew a job had finished, and none of
  that reached a listener without a parent link, so the buddy could not check
  in on work the owner had delegated.
* **The false-ACCEPT half, which is the expensive one.** Everything in the
  buddy's spool is eventually SPOKEN — the notifier volunteers unread mail at a
  gap (#962). So a producer that spools the fleet's ordinary churn does not add
  a feature, it turns the buddy into a narrator, and the owner's move against a
  narrator is to stop listening. That is why the ruling
  (:data:`fleet_activity.ANNOUNCE` plus the kinds in
  ``fleet_alerts.DETECTOR_KINDS``) is pinned here as DATA: widening what may
  speak has to be a deliberate edit to a test that says why.

The sharpest single case is ``spoke``. A session that speaks through fleet TTS
is heard by the owner in the room; a buddy that reads it back is the two-surface
problem made worse, not solved. It is recorded and never announced, and that is
asserted directly rather than left to follow from a table.
