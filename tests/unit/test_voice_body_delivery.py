"""The rendered body, measured against the REAL delivery path (branch-only).

The §4b body is the authorizing evidence for a write the owner made by voice.
Corrupting its delivery corrupts the evidence, so the constraints on it are
measured against the actual functions the drain calls — not against a model of
them.

Three properties, each with a named failure:

1. **One line.** A multi-line paste renders in Claude Code as the
   ``[Pasted text #N +M lines]`` chip and *nothing else*. ``flush_session``'s
   ``stuck`` test is a plain substring match against the box content, so it
   finds nothing, the #689 ``finish_submit`` heal never runs, ``_box_static``
   classifies it no-penalty after three sweeps, and the message is
   **permanently wedged: never healed, never dead-lettered, therefore never
   emailed** — surfacing only via ``doctor`` after two hours. For a channel
   justified by "the owner is not watching a screen", that is the worst
   available failure.
2. **Short enough that the box shows the whole thing.** The ``stuck`` test has
   no #851 window path, so a single-line body too long to render whole fails
   the heal the same way.
3. **Short enough to sit inside the dedup capture.** ``VERIFY_SCROLLBACK_LINES``
   bounds ``message_on_scrollback``; a needle that scrolls partly out returns
   False, the message stays pending, and it re-pastes — a duplicate delivery,
   which is "the orchestrator acts twice", the exact §4 failure.

The pane geometry here is real but small (80 columns), which is the
conservative direction: a narrower pane wraps more, so passing at 80 implies
passing wider.
