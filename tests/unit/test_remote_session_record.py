"""A remote launch records the same identity a local one does (#886).

#871 made every session-launch path record its identity, but the remote
``cmd_new`` branch passed only ``created_via`` — so an explicit
``--created-by`` was silently dropped and the session's ROLE
(orchestrator/worker/reviewer) was never written. The other remote paths
(``recreate`` / ``fork`` / ``history resume``) already pass ``role`` and have
no ``--created-by`` flag of their own, local or remote; the asymmetry was
``new``'s alone. These tests pin both halves.
