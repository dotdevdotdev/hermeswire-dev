"""#933 / #922 / #949 — pin rules to the OPERATION, not the phrasing.

Three defects of one family (a rule guarding a command's spelling selects for
whoever writes it differently, and refuses whoever spells a *different*
operation the same way):

- **#933** — ``_cmd_to_regex`` truncated a tooldef ``cmd:`` at the first flag
  and terminated with ``\\b``, which matches before ``-``. So the write rule
  for ``git merge`` swallowed ``git merge-base`` (read-only), and ``git stash``
  swallowed ``git stash list``. Fixed by the ``(?![\\w-])`` terminator plus
  read-exclusions generated from the same tooldef's ``access: read`` commands.
- **#922** — the path ladders matched destructive-verb patterns against the
  RAW command (so a grep whose search string mentions a deletion was refused
  as one), and anchored rules matched anywhere in the masked haystack (so a
  single-word quoted operand could supply the verb). Fixed by
  ``path_ladder_haystacks`` and command-position enforcement.
- **#949** — ``hermeswire.yaml``'s rm rules matched ANY rm that mentioned
  ``.hermeswire`` anywhere, refusing single-file cleanup inside the state dir
  with a message claiming directory destruction. Fixed by keying the rule on
  the operation: recursive/force flag AND a path terminating at the directory.

Every assertion here names the RULE ID (or its absence), never just the
verdict — a generic rule catching a command incidentally must not read as
coverage (#933 scope item 3). Mutations prove the fixes are load-bearing and
are themselves asserted to have changed the corpus (#922 acceptance).
