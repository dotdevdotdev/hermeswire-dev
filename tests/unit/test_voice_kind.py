"""Slice 1b: ``voice`` is a first-class message kind (#985).

The only voice-layer change that alters behaviour for sessions with nothing to
do with voice — which is why it is its own reviewable diff, and why these tests
are pointed at the blast radius *outside* the voice layer.

Three things are asserted here and nowhere else:

1. **The owner's ruling, as data** (2026-08-10) — ``voice`` is ACTIVE (never
   passive, so it drives a session exactly as typing at it would) and IS in
   ``ESCALATE_KINDS`` (a dead-lettered voice message emails the owner, because
   the owner spoke it and walked away). And the distinction the ruling is most
   easily misread as: escalatable is **not** the interrupt tier. ``escalation``
   remains the only kind that pre-empts.

2. **One derivation, not four literals.** ``doctor``, ``worktree --list`` and
   ``worktree --watch`` each carried a hand-written ``("done", "escalation")``
   tuple. With ``voice`` added to ``ESCALATE_KINDS``, a missed copy makes a
   dead-lettered voice message email the owner on one path and vanish on
   another. :func:`inbox.load_bearing` is the one implementation; the
   set-equality assertion is what stops a future kind escaping it.

3. **The ``_cohort_held`` interaction**, which is the non-obvious part: it
   filters by SENDER, not kind, so a brand-new kind silently inherits the hold
   while ``cohort.REPORT_KINDS`` (which does filter by kind) does not know it.

        out ``note|done|request|escalation``. That copy had already gone stale
        on ``ingest`` before ``voice`` existed, which is the same defect step 3
        exists to prevent, in the surface an agent actually consults.

        Prose cannot derive from the enum, so it gets the next best thing: any
        pipe-separated run naming two or more kinds must name them ALL.

        now two documents: with ``beta.voice_layer`` off its text is pinned
        byte-for-byte to ``origin/main`` (``tests/unit/test_beta_flag.py``), so

        the gated block restates ``kind`` in full, so a new kind that lands

        gate introduced, and the fix for it is a change to main.

        ``SKILL.md`` files are not gated and not part of any shipped system
