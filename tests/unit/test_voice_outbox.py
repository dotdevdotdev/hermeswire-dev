"""Tests for the buddy's self-observation surface (#958) and the narrow
epistemic boundary that pairs with it (#956).

The defect these guard: the buddy had nine read tools and not one showed what
it SENT. Asked "did the code word end up in the message you sent?" it had no
instrument that could answer, scraped the recipient's terminal instead, and
confabulated. Two halves land together:

1. **The outbox** (:mod:`hermeswire.voice_layer.outbox`): every executed write
   is recorded — proposal id, recipient, THE EXACT RENDERED BODY THAT RAN, the
   argv, timestamp, dispatch outcome — and per-message delivery state is
   computed from the recipient's real inbox, never stored and never guessed.
2. **The boundary in the instructions**: decline ONLY where no instrument
   exists; everywhere an instrument exists the instruction is LOOK. Both
   directions are asserted, because a blanket refusal would make the buddy
   *worse* — in a screenless channel "I don't know" is barely an upgrade on a
   confident wrong answer.

What matters most here is recorded-not-reconstructed: the body written to the
outbox must be ``argv[-1]`` of what actually executed, not a re-render. Worker
A is changing what ``render_body`` produces (#953); recording the executed
string keeps this tool correct through that change unseen.
