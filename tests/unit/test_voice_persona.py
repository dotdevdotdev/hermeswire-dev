"""The persona is legible from the repo, and its properties are pinned (#967).

Spoken-surface strings are the category that never gets tests naturally — a
wrong sentence and a right sentence are structurally identical at review time
(the voice-layer doc's maintenance note). The persona is the largest spoken
surface of all, so its load-bearing properties are asserted rather than left
as prose someone can soften in passing:

- the peer stance names the failure mode it designs against (the deferential
  narrator), not just the virtue it wants;
- the humour rule is a countable BUDGET a model can follow, not an adjective;
- opinion and fact are distinguished by ownership, composing with the #956
  epistemic boundary instead of contradicting it;
- insistence is described as the second attempt, and the interrupt decision is
  explicitly located in code — prompt compliance is not a gate;
- the support-layer boundary survives verbatim in spirit: never writes code,
  never owns a worktree, never creates a session.

#980 adds the other half of that job: a sentence in this prompt is a guarantee
the buddy speaks and acts on, so where the prose states something broader than
the code enforces, the prose is wrong. Three of those are pinned below AGAINST
THE CODE rather than against their own wording — the volunteering set (which
the client drives, not the model), the limits sentence (which must derive from
what is wired, not assert a negative the next wiring falsifies), and the reply
nudge (which ``render_body`` drops whole whenever the body runs long).
