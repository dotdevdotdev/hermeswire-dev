"""Ordinary CLI commands must write NOTHING to stderr (#1018).

Two symptoms, one root cause. ``build_parser()`` imports every ``*_cli``
module, and ``buddy_cli`` reached ``voice_layer.tools`` → ``mcp_core`` for one
subprocess helper. Importing ``mcp_core`` does two things no CLI invocation
asked for:

1. constructs the FastMCP singleton, whose settings model carries an
   unresolved forward reference — pydantic-settings >= 2.15 warns about it on
   every instantiation; and
2. calls ``logging.basicConfig(level=INFO)``, which configures the ROOT logger
   for the whole process, promoting library INFO records (the STT config line)
   into CLI stderr.

**Which of these pins is live depends on the installed dependencies, so say so
rather than claim a blanket guarantee.** Measured against the unfixed tree:

- ``uv.lock`` (pydantic-settings 2.14.2 / mcp 1.27.2 — what CI runs): 5 of the
  7 go red. The two that do not are the ``--version`` and ``roles list``
  stderr assertions; neither command loads config, and 2.14.2 emits no warning,
  so there is nothing for them to catch there. They are the forward-looking
  half — they bite the moment the pinned deps move up.
- pydantic-settings 2.15.0 / mcp 1.29.0 (the versions that reproduce the
  reported symptom): all 7 go red.

Every half of the bug therefore has at least one live control under the locked
set: the STT line via ``projects list`` and the log-level test, and the
pydantic warning via the two structural pins, which key on state and ordering
rather than on the warning and so hold on every version.

    Two facts make the obvious assertions useless here, both verified rather

    - Only pydantic-settings >= 2.15 warns about the unresolved forward
      reference, and ``uv.lock`` pins 2.14.2 — so a warning-based assertion is
      vacuous under exactly the dependency set CI runs, which is no control at
      all for the headline symptom of #1018.
    - ``Settings.__pydantic_complete__`` read *after* importing ``mcp_core`` is
      True on the unfixed tree too: constructing ``FastMCP()`` completes the
      model as a side effect of validation (which is why upstream warns instead
      of raising). Sampled there, the flag cannot tell the trees apart.

    What actually distinguishes them is whether the model was ALREADY complete
    at the moment ``mcp_core`` constructed the server — i.e. that the rebuild
    runs first. So spy on ``FastMCP.__init__`` and sample the flag inside it.
    Version-independent, and it pins the ordering the fix depends on, which
    nothing else does.

    The ``RENAMED`` branch is not redundant: ``mcp_core`` guards the rebuild
    with ``getattr`` so an upstream rename cannot take the whole tool surface
    down, and that guard degrades to a silent no-op. This is what notices it.
