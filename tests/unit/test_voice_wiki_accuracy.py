"""The wiki page is a testable artifact, and #981 is why.

`docs/wiki/voice-layer.md` accumulated sentences that were correct when written
and were falsified by later code — including two that made **opposite security
claims** in one repo. The lesson the sweep produced is not "re-read the wiki
sometimes": it is that a load-bearing sentence needs a pin, and a pin has to be
DERIVED from the code wherever it can be, so the next behaviour change fails a
test rather than quietly re-opening the gap.

So most assertions here read something out of `hermeswire/voice_layer/` and look
for it in the page. The few that are literal strings are the ones where the
defect was the SHAPE of a claim — a promise of immediacy, a guarantee stated one
token wide — and there is nothing in the code to derive that from.

Every test in this module was watched RED against the pre-#981 wording. A pin
that passes against the sentence it was written to forbid is not a pin.

**The drift can flip polarity, so the pins are two-sided.** The first round of
this sweep fixed the page and left the identical false claims in the module
docstrings one file away — six of them describing the pre-#951 anchor, and one
saying `wait` denies unconditionally. A pin scoped to the page proves the page,
which is exactly the "testing a table's entries against themselves" trap
`confirm.py` records one level down. So the claims that exist on both sides are
asserted on both sides, over `SOURCES` below.
