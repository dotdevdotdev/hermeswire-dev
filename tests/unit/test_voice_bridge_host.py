"""The bridge's Host guard and its body-length guard (#977).

Both are about a request the bearer token does not defend against.

**The Host guard.** The bridge binds ``127.0.0.1`` and mints a per-run bearer
token, and neither of those stops a REMOTE page from driving it. DNS rebinding
is the attack: a page served from ``evil.com`` re-resolves that name to
``127.0.0.1``, so the browser treats ``http://evil.com:8788/`` as same-origin,
fetches ``/`` — which is served with no auth at all — reads the ``TOKEN``
embedded in the page, and POSTs ``/tool`` with it. The loopback bind never
sees a foreign packet; the BROWSER is the confused deputy. What separates the
attack from the real client is the ``Host`` header, which the browser sets from
the address bar and script cannot forge.

So these tests drive **raw sockets**, not ``http.client``: the whole subject is
a header ``http.client`` writes for you, and a test that lets the library set
``Host`` is asserting on its own fixture.

Both halves of the guard are priced, and the false-reject half is the
expensive one — a legitimate local client refused in a screenless channel is a
buddy that goes silently dead. So the accepted set is asserted explicitly,
against how the client ACTUALLY connects: ``client.py`` fetches ``/tool``,
``/mint``, ``/utterance``, ``/anchor`` as **relative paths**, so the Host on
every request is whatever the owner typed in the address bar — the
``127.0.0.1:<port>`` the CLI prints, or the ``localhost:<port>`` a human types
instead, in whatever case they typed it.

**The body-length guard.** ``rfile.read(-5)`` reads to EOF, so a negative
``Content-Length`` parks a handler thread until the client goes away — one
leaked thread per request, and on a threading server nothing else reports it.
