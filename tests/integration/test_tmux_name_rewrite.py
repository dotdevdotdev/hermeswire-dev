"""``tmux_safe_name`` is verified against REAL tmux, not against our belief (#878).

``worktree.tmux_safe_name`` is safe to apply at *resolution* time only because
it MIRRORS tmux's own name mapping — the name it derives is the name tmux will
have chosen. That invariant is about an external binary's behavior, so a unit
test asserting our own constants can't establish it. This drives actual
``tmux new-session`` on a private socket and reads back the name tmux really
created.

Why it earns its keep: #865 → #868 → #870 → #878 is four rounds of this class,
three of them because the rewrite set was assumed rather than measured. If a
future tmux starts rewriting another character, THIS is the test that fails —
instead of a teardown silently killing nothing while reporting success.

Never touches the user's live tmux server: every command runs against a
dedicated ``-S <socket>`` in a short-lived temp dir (macOS caps Unix-domain
socket paths at ~104 bytes, so pytest's tmp_path is too long to use directly —
same constraint as test_send_verified_tmux.py).
