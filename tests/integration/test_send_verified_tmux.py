"""Real-tmux integration test for session_ready.send_verified (#621).

The unit tests mock paste/Enter/capture; this drives an ACTUAL tmux pane through
the real `paste-buffer` + `send-keys Enter` + `capture-pane` round-trip, so a
regression in the paste→land→submit→confirm mechanic (the failure behind both
the polite-msg redelivery loop and notify-parent "sat there unsent") is caught.

The pane runs a tiny terminal app that emulates Claude Code's input box: it
renders the `❯`-prefixed box between two horizontal rules (so
`prompt_router.input_box_content` parses it), treats newline bytes from a paste
as LITERAL text (Claude's bracketed-paste semantics — pasted newlines don't
submit), and treats a carriage-return (the real Enter keystroke tmux sends) as
SUBMIT: the buffer clears and the turn scrolls into history. Crucially the
emulator shows NO spinner/activity after submit and lets the turn scroll out of
view — the exact "quiet submit" shape that false-negatived the old check.
