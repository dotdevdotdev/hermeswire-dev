    Load-bearing, and subtle. The redirect below works by rebinding
    module-level constants that were computed at import time — but it can only
    rebind modules that are *already imported*. Much of this codebase imports
    lazily inside functions (``from hermeswire.__main__ import
    build_agent_command`` inside a test helper), so without this the first
    test to trigger such an import does it while ``$HOME`` already points at
    that test's tmp directory. The module then computes
    ``CONFIG_DIR = Path.home() / ".hermeswire"`` against the *fake* home and
    freezes it there — permanently, for the rest of the session, because
    monkeypatch never patched it and so has nothing to restore.

    The symptom is a constant stuck at some early test's tmp path, which is
    exactly the kind of cross-test bleed this fixture exists to prevent. Doing
    the imports up front means every constant is computed against the real
    home, so the per-test walk both rebinds and restores it.

    Best-effort: a submodule that cannot import (optional dependency, platform
    guard) is skipped rather than failing collection.

    """No test may read or write the real ``~/.hermeswire`` — ever (#893).

    Found the hard way: ``~/.hermeswire/sessions/resumed/metadata.json`` was a
    live record in the owner's config directory, written by this suite and
    grown to 80 fabricated conversation ids — one appended per full-suite run,
    because ``conversation_ids`` is a chain by design (#871). Beyond tests
    mutating real user state being a defect on its own, it corrupted a
    measurement: sizing #871's orphaned-history doctor check against the real
    store surfaced 28 recorded ids with no transcript, *all* from that one
    record, with zero genuine orphans behind them.

    Two levers, because there are two ways a path gets computed:

    1. **``$HOME``** — ``Path.home()`` resolves through ``expanduser``, which
       reads the variable, so redirecting it catches everything computed at
       *call* time, including modules imported later by a lazy import.
    2. **A walk over loaded modules** — roughly forty constants across ~25
       modules are computed at *import* time
       (``COHORT_ROOT = Path.home() / ".hermeswire" / "cohorts"`` and friends)
       and are already frozen before any fixture runs. Rebinding them by
       walking beats enumerating them: a hand-written list would rot the first
       time someone adds a constant, which is exactly how this class of bug
       recurs. ``test_home_isolation.py`` asserts the walk missed nothing.
