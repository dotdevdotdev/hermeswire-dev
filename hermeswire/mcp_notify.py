    notification (the `session` below); a toast with no session is non-clickable.

    With `artifact_url` set, the toast instead becomes a click-to-open artifact
    notice (#817): it sticks until dismissed, also appears in the Session HUD,
    and clicking it opens that artifact window — use this to hand the human a
    rendered deliverable without stealing focus.

    Args:
        text: Notification text. Bold (**x**), line breaks, and [links](https://…)
            render; everything else is escaped.
        session: Session this relates to (shown as a badge).
        priority: 'normal' or 'high' (high gets an accent border).
        artifact_url: URL or ~/.hermeswire/artifacts/ filename to open on click.
