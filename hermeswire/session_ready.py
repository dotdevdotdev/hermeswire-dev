"""Agent readiness detection and verified message delivery.

Consolidates the readiness/verification primitives that grew up separately
in worktree dispatch (wait_for_session_ready) and council (send_verified): a
freshly-booted Hermes REPL renders its prompt before its input handler is
wired, so a paste in that window vanishes silently. Every subsystem that
injects a first prompt into a new session — council, `hermeswire send
--wait-ready`, `hermeswire new --first-message` — routes through here.

Hermes readiness differs from Claude Code's in one load-bearing way: its
prompt_toolkit REPL draws the ``❯`` prompt as part of its readline loop, so
once the prompt glyph is on screen the input handler IS wired. No keystroke
probe is needed (that was Claude's fix for its banner-render race), and there
is no trust-this-folder prompt or ``[Pasted text]`` chip. The verified paste
keys on the prompt line instead of Claude's horizontal-rule box.

    A failed seed can leave a partial paste in the box, which (a) confuses a

    (``prompt_router.prompt_is_empty``), so "cleared" here means exactly
    "the drain will deliver". Returns True iff the box ends up empty.

    Escape alone is not enough (#851). A draft taller than the box's visible
    region ignores it — measured on the wedged pane: 3 Escapes, 9.4s, box
    unchanged, and ``C-u`` (kill-to-line-start) is equally inert on a draft
