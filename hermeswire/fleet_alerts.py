"""Fleet detectors, addressed as typed mail — the producer side of the kind axis (#982).

Every detector in this repo already knows how to tell the OWNER something: the
shared Resend wiring, best-effort, throttled by whatever state the detector
already keeps. What none of them could do is tell a *session*. This module is
that half, and it is deliberately the same shape as the email one: one call,
never raises, and inert when nobody is listening.

**The kind IS the policy.** ``inbox`` already types mail — ``note`` / ``done`` /
``request`` / ``escalation`` — and consumers key on the type rather than
re-deriving urgency for themselves. So the only real decision this module makes
is which kind each detector gets, and that decision lives in one place as data:
:data:`DETECTOR_KINDS`. The rulings, and what each one costs, are in
``docs/wiki/sessions/messaging.md``.

**Why the ruling is the hard part.** ``escalation`` is the one kind a consumer
may act on out of turn. A producer that over-fires does not add noise, it
retires the tier — a recipient that learns escalations are usually ignorable
will ignore the one that wasn't. So the bar is not "is this true?" (all five
candidate detectors are true when they fire) but "can this clear without a
human, and is something burning while it waits?" Two detectors pass. One is
demoted to ``note`` because it self-heals, one has a floor of ``request`` with
an inherit rule, and one is not wired at all. That is the whole design.

**Subscription is a LEASE, not a flag.** A subscriber records
:data:`SUBSCRIBE_KEY` in its ``metadata.json`` (the #871 SSOT store, so there
is no second registry to drift) carrying an expiry it must renew. The reason is
the dormancy failure: the inbox's own liveness gates are about *pasting into a
pane*, so a recipient that reads its mail some other way never reads as gone
the way a dead tmux session does. A permanent flag would keep producing into a
queue nobody is draining, and hand the whole backlog over at once whenever that
recipient next came up — every message arriving with the priority it was sent
with, long after any of it was actionable. An expired lease fails QUIET, which
is the correct direction for a producer whose expensive failure is
over-production.

Nothing here knows what a subscriber is. Anything with a session record and an
inbox can lease one, and no detector below gains a dependency on any of them.

#: Session-record key holding the subscription lease.
SUBSCRIBE_KEY = "fleet_alerts"

#: Sender stamped on every alert. Load-bearing, not cosmetic: it is how the
#: dead-letter detector recognizes its own undelivered mail and declines to
#: alert about the alert (see ``inbox._escalate_dead_letters``).
SENDER = "fleet-alerts"

#: Sender stamped on the fleet's ordinary comings and goings
#: (:mod:`~hermeswire.fleet_activity`, #1016). Separate from :data:`SENDER` so a
#: recipient can tell "the machine is broken" from "the machine did something",
#: and defined HERE so the recursion guard below can name both without
#: importing the producer.
ACTIVITY_SENDER = "fleet-activity"

#: Mail this machine sends itself. A dead-lettered one must not buy an alarm
#: about the alarm — see ``inbox._alert_dead_letters``, which drops these by
#: sender. Activity mail joins the set for the same reason plus one of its own:
#: it is news by construction, so "a 'session went idle' notice was lost" does
#: not earn a fleet-wide alert. It does still ride the dead-letter owner EMAIL
#: (``_escalate_dead_letters``), which is deliberately left alone — that path is
#: last-resort visibility, already coalesced to one message per batch.
MACHINE_SENDERS = frozenset({SENDER, ACTIVITY_SENDER})

#: How long a lease is good for without renewal. Long enough that a working
#: session renewed at startup keeps hearing about the fleet for a full day of
#: use; short enough that a subscriber which ran once last week is not still
#: accumulating interrupts. A long-running subscriber past this simply goes
#: quiet until it renews — see the module docstring on failing quiet.
DEFAULT_LEASE = timedelta(hours=12)

#: THE RULING. Which detector's event earns which kind — pinned as data so that
#: changing what may interrupt is an edit somebody has to justify, not a literal
#: buried at a call site. Rationale per entry:
#:
#: ``auth_expired`` → **escalation**. Machine-wide: every subsequent turn on the
#:   host is refused, and nothing clears it but a human running ``/login``.
#:   Bounded to once per ``auth_expired.ESCALATE_TTL`` per outage, machine-wide,
#:   by the outage record itself.
#:
#: ``blocked_pane_no_parent`` → **escalation**. A ROOT session blocked on an
#:   interactive prompt has, by design, nobody to route to; it is stalled until
#:   a human answers, and some of those prompts have deadlines. Bounded to once
#:   per ``prompt_router.NO_PARENT_ESCALATE_TTL`` per distinct prompt.
#:
#: ``usage_limit_park`` → **note**. Demoted deliberately. The park is
#:   self-healing — the reset time is parsed, the resume nudge is armed, and the
#:   owner's own email says "no action needed". Worth hearing at a gap; it
#:   cannot earn an interrupt when there is nothing to interrupt anyone FOR.
#:
#: ``dead_letter`` → **request**, with one inherit rule: if what was lost was
#:   itself an ``escalation``, the alert is an escalation, because the fleet
#:   already made that judgment and losing it is the failure. The floor is
#:   ``request`` because the realistic bad case is a permanently-stuck
#:   recipient — 147 dead letters in ~2s, once — and that shape must not be
#:   able to buy 147 interrupts. Bounded to one alert per dead-letter BATCH,
#:   the same coalescing the digest email already does.
#:
#: Not here, and on purpose: ``worktree --dangling``. It has no autonomous
#: trigger (only ``doctor`` and the explicit flag, both run by a human already
#: looking at the output) and no per-finding throttle state to reuse, so a
#: producer would re-announce the same durable, passive condition on every
#: invocation. A dangling PR is not burning anything while it waits.
#: The four below are DETECTORS — the machine reporting that something is
#: wrong. The three after them are LIFECYCLE events (#1016): the fleet
#: reporting that something happened. They share this table because the
#: question is the same one — what may a producer put in front of a listener,
#: and how loudly — and answering it in two places is how the two answers
#: drift. What lifecycle events may NEVER be is ``escalation``: the interrupt
#: tier stays the two conditions above that nothing clears without a human.
#: Which lifecycle events reach the spool AT ALL, and how often, is the
#: separate ruling in :data:`hermeswire.fleet_activity.ANNOUNCE`.
#:
#: ``session_idle`` → **done**. Work somebody delegated has finished and is
#:   waiting on a decision. Only ever emitted for a delegated session (a
#:   recorded parent, a worker/reviewer role, or a worktree) — an interactive
#:   orchestrator goes idle after every turn, and announcing that would fire
#:   once per exchange the owner has with their own session.
#:
#: ``task_completed`` → **done**, with one inherit rule: a failed or timed-out
#:   run is emitted as ``request``, because the fleet has already judged it as
#:   needing a person and flattening that to news throws the judgment away.
#:   Same shape as ``dead_letter``'s inherit rule above.
#:
#: ``toast_high`` → **request**. ``notify-user --priority high`` is the one
#:   notify surface that declares its own urgency, and it declares it about a
#:   screen the owner may not be looking at. An ordinary toast is not here at
#:   all — it never reaches the spool.
