"""Reap bare-shell scheduler sessions (#739).

``_dispatch_worktree_task`` names every worktree branch
``scheduler-<task>-<ts>``. If the session's launch crashes before the agent
starts (e.g. the worktree directory went missing between ``hermeswire new``
reporting success and the pane's ``cd``), the tmux session drops to a bare
shell — which the idle-reaper correctly never touches, since it only reaps a
*running* agent that goes idle. Nothing else would ever clean that up, so it
lingers indefinitely. This module finds and kills those sessions.

Detected by branch naming rather than ``worktree_registry``. Scheduler
dispatch does register now (#837 routed ``hermeswire new``'s worktree
creation through the shared create+register helper), but registration is not
the right signal here: the zombie case is precisely a session whose worktree
DIRECTORY went missing after creation, and the tmux+branch-name scan finds
it without depending on any bookkeeping surviving the crash.
