    ``tmux new-session -d -s .foo`` succeeds and gives you a session named
    ``_foo``, and ``-s a:b`` gives you ``a_b``. This mirrors tmux's own
    mapping rather than inventing one — which is what makes it safe to apply
    at *resolution* time, since the name derived here is the name tmux will
    have chosen.

    Creation applied it inline (five copies in ``session_cli``); resolution
    didn't. So for a project directory containing a dot (``~/.claude``),
    teardown looked for ``.claude-fix`` while the session was
    ``_claude-fix`` — matched nothing, killed nothing, reported success, and
    left the session running in the directory it had just deleted (#868).
    ``:`` was the same hole, reachable through an operator-supplied name
    rather than a derived one (#878).

    Slashes are preserved — ``project/branch`` is a legal tmux name and is
    the convention ``cmd_new`` builds for worktree sessions.

    **The substitution set is exactly these two** — established by sweeping
    every printable ASCII character through ``tmux new-session`` on an
    isolated socket (tmux 3.5a), not by reading tmux's source and hoping.
    UTF-8 passes through untouched. tmux does *also* transform ``\\``, tab,
    newline and other control characters, but by **vis-escaping** them (``\\t``,
    ``\\001``) — an expansion to a longer string, not a 1:1 substitution — so it
    can't be mirrored by a ``replace`` and isn't attempted here. Such a name
    would break this function's fixed-point invariant, but it is not reachable
    from what actually feeds these names: project directory names and
    operator/agent-supplied session names. See ``TestTmuxRewriteSet``, which

    Wraps :func:`ensure_worktree` (idempotent: an existing worktree is
    adopted, not recreated) and always registers the result, so re-running a
    creation heals a missing registry entry instead of leaving an orphan.

    A pre-existing directory that git does **not** know as a worktree is a
    hard failure, not something to register: launching an agent into a plain
    directory that merely sits at the worktree path is the silent-corruption
    case this guards.

    before clearing a build-tool cache dir left inside, or the admin file
    under `.git/worktrees/` was pruned independently. In that state git
    reports "fatal: ... is not a working tree" for every future removal
    attempt, forever — this lets a caller distinguish that from a real
    registered worktree that `remove --force` merely failed to clear. It
    says nothing about whether the directory holds valuable content — that
    judgment (e.g. "orphaned + unregistered is safe to hard-delete") belongs
    to the caller, not this function.

    errors (corrupt repo, I/O, lock contention), that's reported as
