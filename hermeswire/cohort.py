"""Fan-out cohort ledger — a parent's outstanding children (#852).

A scheduled task that fans out child sessions had no way to wait for them.
The parent went idle while *waiting*, the idle handler read idle as done, and
the task was reaped — killing the roll-up the parent existed to write and
orphaning the children's report-backs into dead-letter (which, for
load-bearing kinds, also emails the owner about work that succeeded). The
children themselves were full ``hermeswire new`` sessions, so nothing reaped
them either: a nightly fan-out leaked N sessions per run.

**idle != done for a session with outstanding children.** This module is the
one artifact that makes that knowable, with three consumers:

1. ``hermeswire wait --children`` (:func:`wait`) — the join primitive. Blocking
   inside a tool call is not idle, so the hook never fires and the agent
   resumes naturally to write its roll-up.
2. The idle-handler guard — a file-existence + ``jq`` check in the same shape
   as the usage-limit park guard and the #276 prompt-router guard. It reads
   ``state == "pending"`` and ``deadline`` directly out of the JSON, so those
   two field names are load-bearing across the language boundary.
3. The watchdog sweeper (:func:`tick`) — the anti-leak backstop. It reaps a
   cohort whose parent died mid-wait, and reconciles a live parent's ledger so
   the guard self-clears as children exit.

**Cohort is not rooting.** ``created_by`` (#715) answers "who has authority /
where do prompts route", and deliberately returns nothing for a *cross-project*
spawn. The 2026-08-01 fan-out was three cross-project children and one
same-project one, so a ``created_by``-derived guard would have protected
exactly one child and reaped the parent out from under the other three. A
half-linked fan-out is worse than an unlinked one, so cohort membership is
keyed off the CALLER, independent of the rooting decision.

**Ordering is load-bearing.** ``hermeswire kill`` runs ``inbox.gc_sender()``,
which dead-letters the killed session's still-pending load-bearing outbound
**and emails the owner**. Kill-before-collect turns every child's ``done``
report into owner email. So: collect the report, consume it, THEN kill.

Everything here fails OPEN: a missing, corrupt, or expired ledger must never be
able to wedge a task alive forever.
