"""Local branch↔session registry for worktree sessions.

hermeswire-owned **local state** — never provider data. It records which
worktree sessions exist for a repo so the `hermeswire worktree` command can
list, clean up, and recover them robustly when 4–5 branches are in flight
at once (inference from the `{project}-{branch}` session name alone is
fragile at that scale).

Layout: one JSON file per repo under ``~/.hermeswire/worktrees/``, keyed by
the repo's absolute path. Each file holds a list of entries:

    {
      "project": "/Users/me/projects/monorepo",
      "entries": [
        {"branch": "fix-bug", "session": "monorepo-fix-bug",
         "base": "develop", "worktree_path": "/Users/me/worktrees/monorepo/fix-bug",
         "created_at": "2026-06-14T10:30:00-04:00",
         "kind": "worker", "topology": "worktree"}
      ]
    }

Files are plain JSON and **hand-editable** — delete a stale entry by hand,
or run ``hermeswire worktree --prune`` to drop entries whose worktree path
no longer exists.

    they record the path git actually reports rather than whatever the
    caller string-built (#855).

    ``kind`` (#716) is the session's ROLE at registration time ("worker" or

    ``session_cli.scan_dangling_worktrees``) can tell a safety-railed worker
    (which structurally can't self-merge and needs a live reviewer) apart
    from a self-rooted orchestrator (full authority, expected to be
    parentless — flagging it as "dangling" would be a false positive).

    ``topology`` (#837) is the orthogonal WHERE axis: "worktree" for a
    standalone worktree *session* (``session`` names a tmux session that IS
    this worktree), "pane" for a worker pane's isolated branch created by
    ``hermeswire spawn --branch`` (``session`` names the *owning* session,
    whose pane 0 is an unrelated orchestrator). Teardown must not kill the
    session of a "pane" entry — that would take down the orchestrator, not
    the worker.

    The full read-modify-write is held under an exclusive flock so
    concurrent registration processes serialize instead of clobbering.
