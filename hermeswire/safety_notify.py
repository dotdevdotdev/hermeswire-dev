"""Owner notification for unattended damage-control blocks — spooled, throttled,
digested (#925).

Every ``ask``-tier command an unattended (scheduler) session hits is blocked
fail-closed, and until now every one of those blocks sent its own email the
instant it fired. Measured over 14 days that was 96 emails and accelerating —
28 in one day — of which 52 were the SAME rule (``core.ambiguous-command``) and
most were the same rule in the same session, looping. An owner who deletes 28
identical emails a day is an owner who stops reading the 29th, which is the one
that matters. Unthrottled notification is not "loud", it is off.

The shape here is not invented: it is the one this repo already uses twice for
out-of-band owner escalation, and deliberately reuses rather than adding a
third dialect.

* :mod:`hermeswire.auth_expired` — a persisted ``escalated_at`` stamp and an
  ``ESCALATE_TTL`` of one hour, so a persistent condition emails on first
  sighting and then at most hourly.
* :func:`hermeswire.inbox._escalate_dead_letters` — ONE digest email per batch
  rather than one per item, after a recipient that had been undeliverable for a
  while produced 147 individual emails in ~2 seconds (2026-07-19).

This module is both at once, because a block has neither shape on its own: it
is a stream of discrete events (like dead letters) that describes a persistent
condition (like an outage). So events are **spooled**, aggregated by
``(rule_id, session)``, and released as a digest at most once per
:data:`THROTTLE`.

Three properties are load-bearing:

**The audit log is untouched.** The hook calls ``log_blocked`` BEFORE it calls
this notifier, on a separate path, and nothing here can suppress it. Throttling
the email while also throttling the record would trade spam for blindness —
``hermeswire safety logs`` stays complete whatever this module decides, and the
digest points at it.

**Repeats do not re-notify, but they are never lost.** A task looping on one
blocked command is one *fact*, not forty, so a ``(rule_id, session)`` pair
already reported within :data:`DEDUP_TTL` does not by itself trigger another
digest. Its count keeps accumulating in the spool and rides along on the next
digest that does fire, and :data:`DEDUP_TTL` expiry means a condition that
never resolves still re-reports daily rather than going permanently quiet.

**Nothing here may raise.** The caller is a fire-and-forget subprocess spawned
off a security hook that has ALREADY blocked the command. An exception in the
notifier cannot un-block anything; it can only turn a clean block into a
confusing one. Every public entry point returns rather than propagates.
