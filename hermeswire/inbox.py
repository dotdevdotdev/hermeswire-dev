"""Polite agent-to-agent messaging — the ``hermeswire msg`` inbox.

A durable, non-interrupting channel for sessions to talk amongst themselves.
Unlike ``hermeswire send`` / ``session_send`` (which paste into the prompt and
press Enter *immediately* — forceful control, and the right tool when you
need it), ``msg`` drops a typed message into a per-recipient file inbox and
only injects it when the recipient's Claude Code input box is empty and the
pane is a safe delivery target. A worker reporting back can no longer clobber
a half-typed human draft.

Layout under ``~/.hermeswire/inbox/``::

    <session>/                      # one dir per recipient session
      1718323456789-a1b2c3.json     # <epoch_ms>-<short_uuid>.json (sort = order)
      .lock/                        # mkdir-based drain lock
      dead/                         # messages dropped after MAX_ATTEMPTS
    .tick.lock                      # global flock guarding tick()

"ls is the protocol" — same pattern as Council's ``council/inbox.py``.
Sorting by filename = delivery order. Worktree session names contain ``/`` and
nest a directory level (mirrors ``usage_limit.state_path``); the tick walks
the tree and reconstructs the name from the path.

Delivery = ``safe_deliver`` guards (parked / non-agent / live-dialog refusals
+ verified paste) **plus** the new ``prompt_is_empty`` collision guard.

# Typed message enum, Overstory-inspired — kept deliberately small; this is a
# mailbox, not a workflow engine.
#
# ``ingest`` is the PASSIVE kind: it is never auto-delivered (the watchdog skips
# it), so it never drives the recipient into a turn. It lands silently in an
# ``ingest/`` subdir and waits there until the recipient *voluntarily* pulls it
# (``msg pull``). This is the "awareness without being driven" primitive —
# correspondents drop a passive pointer; the anchor pulls on the human's cue.
#
# ``voice`` is the owner speaking to a session through their voice buddy (#985).
# It replaced a ``<voice>`` marker the buddy used to prepend to the message
# BODY: attribution rode inside the text while the slot that actually drives
# behaviour said ``request``. Owner ruling, 2026-08-10:
#
#   * **ACTIVE, not passive.** A voice message is the owner talking; it should
#     drive the session exactly as typing at it would. Making it passive would
#     be a behaviour *reduction* versus the body prefix it replaces, and this
#     slice is a consistency/SSOT change, not a capability cut.
#   * **In ESCALATE_KINDS.** The owner spoke it and walked away. Screenless, a
#     silently dead-lettered voice message is unrecoverable — there is no
#     screen on which to notice the graveyard entry.
#   * **NOT an interrupt.** ``ESCALATE_KINDS`` governs dead-letter escalation,
#     which is a different axis from the interrupt tier. ``escalation`` remains
#     the only kind that pre-empts (see ``_alert_dead_letters``'s promotion and
#     the buddy client's ``isUrgent``).
#
# ``idle`` is the idle handler SPEAKING FOR a child that went quiet without
# reporting (#952). It used to travel as ``done`` with the sentinel text
# "is idle and done working", which made a placeholder and a genuine report
# the same shape at the point of collection — `wait --children` counted an
# unreviewed PR as reviewed. The kind is the discriminator, never the text:
# a child that legitimately sends those words as its own report stays `done`.
# Synthetic, so NOT load-bearing (a dead-lettered placeholder is no loss).

# A recipient that positively does not exist gets a much shorter window (#694):
# a gone session can't clear its box by itself — it only comes back if someone
# recreates it — so the grace is ~5 watchdog ticks (≈5 min), enough for a

GONE_MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5

# Defer reasons that DON'T penalize: the recipient EXISTS but can't take the
# message right now — it is not refusing. Either it's legitimately busy (running
# a long command → unparseable box → "target_busy"; generating with human-queued
# input → the "queued messages" placeholder → "queued_placeholder"; a box holding
# unrecognized-but-static content → "box_static", identical across consecutive
# sweeps ≈ an unknown placeholder, not an actively-typed draft; our own prior
# paste wedged in the box → "stuck_in_box") — or it's usage-limit PARKED
# ("target_parked"), where pasting would corrupt the resume.
#
# Parked is the *most* clearly temporary of these (#872): a park is bounded and
# self-clearing — usage-limit recovery parses the reset time and nudges the
# session afterward — whereas "busy" has no such guarantee. Penalizing it meant a
# park longer than MAX_ATTEMPTS ticks (~40 min, routinely exceeded by a real
# reset window) killed every report-back its workers had filed.
#
# Such messages stay pending indefinitely instead of burning toward dead-letter,
# and deliver once the box frees up or the park clears. The opposite case — a
# recipient that positively does NOT exist — is NOT in this set: "target_gone"
# is penalized on its own fast GONE_MAX_ATTEMPTS cap (#694).
#
# Never dead-lettering also means never triggering the dead-letter owner email,
# so a load-bearing report can now wait hours with nothing announcing it (#879 —
# a gap that #872 widened by admitting the one reason that legitimately lasts
# hours). `hermeswire msg inbox` shows a queue on request; `hermeswire doctor`

    ``request`` by default: a permanently lost report-back needs somebody to go
    look at ``hermeswire msg dead``, but it is not worth cutting across a
    sentence — and the realistic bad case here is a single stuck recipient that
    dead-lettered 147 messages in ~2s (2026-07-19). One alert per BATCH, the
    same coalescing the digest email already does, so that shape buys one
    message rather than 147.

    The one promotion: if what was lost was itself an ``escalation``, the alert
    is an escalation. That is not this module re-deriving urgency — the sender
    already made the judgment, and a *lost interrupt* is precisely the failure
    the tier exists for.

    **Escalatable is not the interrupt tier**, and this is where the two axes
    are easiest to conflate. ``voice`` joined ``ESCALATE_KINDS`` in #985, so a
    lost voice message reaches the owner by email — but the promotion below
    stays keyed on ``escalation`` alone. Widening it to ``voice`` would make
    every routine spoken message an alarm, which is the "retires the tier"
    failure ``fleet_alerts`` exists to avoid.

    Two recursion guards, because an alert is ordinary mail and can dead-letter
    like any other. The recipient guard alone is not enough once more than one
    session subscribes: an alert stranded on the way to subscriber A would
    otherwise be reported to subscriber B, whose own copy is stuck for the same
    reason, once per drain forever. So our own undelivered alerts are dropped
    by SENDER, and every subscriber named as a recipient is excluded.

    ``MACHINE_SENDERS`` rather than ``SENDER`` alone (#1016): lifecycle activity
    is emitted under its own sender and is news by construction. "A 'session
    went idle' notice was lost" is not worth an alert, and it would arrive
    exactly when the fleet is already noisy enough to be stranding mail.

# ── Coalesced-paste bounds (#930) ─────────────────────────────────────────
# The #689 swallowed-Enter heal reads the input box, and Claude Code's box
# stops showing the full paste in TWO independent regimes governed by
# DIFFERENT variables (measured in a live pane — issue #930):
#
#   LINE COUNT — 4+ rendered lines collapse to the "[Pasted text]" chip
#   (4 lines chip at 87 chars; the same 87 chars on ONE line render as text).
#   The stuck test then matches nothing, so a drain that coalesced 4+
#   messages wedges EVERY one of them: never healed, never dead-lettered,
#   therefore never emailed. Routine on a busy fleet (`wait --children`
#   with four reporting children IS the 4-message coalesce).
#
#   CHARACTER LENGTH — a long single-line paste WINDOWS (the box shows a
#   bounded tail) well before it chips: 520 chars healed, 540 missed, at
#   80×24. So "not a chip" is not evidence the heal will fire, and a fix
#   scoped to the line-count cliff leaves this regime open.
#
# Both bounds therefore apply to the coalesced paste; neither substitutes
# for the other. The char bound sits under the voice layer's measured
# worst-case-clear (~385 against the 520 boundary) because a shorter pane
# windows sooner and this fleet runs 64-column panes. A single message
# whose own render exceeds the char bound is pasted alone — the drain
# cannot split one message; bounding bodies at enqueue is a separate
