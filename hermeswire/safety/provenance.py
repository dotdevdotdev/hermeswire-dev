"""Which checkout is allowed to WRITE machine-global hermeswire config (#936).

Every installer path in hermeswire resolves its source as ``Path(__file__).parent``
— "the package I happen to be running from". That is correct exactly once: when
the process was launched from the canonically installed tool. It is wrong every
other time, and the failure is silent and machine-wide:

    a session on a task branch runs `hermeswire safety install` (or `uv run
    hermeswire ...`, or anything that heals hooks), and its OWN checkout — which
    may predate a P0 security fix by days — is copied over
    ``~/.hermeswire/hooks/damage-control/`` for every other session on the box.

That is not hypothetical: it reverted #918's ``git -C`` bypass fix within an
hour of deployment, from one of six live worktrees carrying the pre-fix package.
``shutil.copy2`` preserves mtime, so the downgraded file looked *older* than the
deployment that it replaced, and ``doctor`` reported ``[ok] DC hook scripts
current`` — correctly, because the installed copy now matched whatever source
last ran.

So the guard is provenance, not version comparison: **only the canonical install
may write machine-global config.** A version stamp (see
``scripts/regen_damage_control_hooks.py``) is a useful second line and is what
lets ``doctor`` say "the installed hook is older than the package", but on its
own it cannot stop a stale branch that has itself regenerated its hooks.

Three states:

``canonical``
    The running package IS the installed tool. Writes proceed.
``bootstrap``
    No canonical install exists yet (fresh machine, CI, a test with a redirected
    ``$HOME``, a checkout-only dev box). Nothing to protect, so writes proceed —
    refusing here would make the tool uninstallable.
``worktree``
    No canonical install, but the running package sits in a git WORKTREE. A task
    branch is never a legitimate bootstrap source, so this refuses too. Refused.
``foreign``
    A canonical install exists and it is NOT what is running. Writes are refused
    unless the caller explicitly forces them.

Two things this deliberately does NOT key on, both measured rather than assumed:

* **The cwd.** ``~/.local/bin/hermeswire`` is a console script with a venv
  shebang, so it imports site-packages regardless of where it is invoked from.
  Running ``hermeswire hooks install`` while sitting in a worktree is already
  safe, and a cwd check would refuse it — while still letting ``uv run
  hermeswire`` from a stale non-worktree checkout poison the machine. Over- and
  under-inclusive at once.
* **``PATH``.** ``uv run`` puts an ephemeral venv first, so a ``which``-based
  lookup would report the stale checkout AS the canonical install.

    ``--allow-foreign-source`` with something undocumented, and — worse — a

    ``masked_subcommands``, so a command-position damage-control rule *cannot
    observe it being set*. An override invisible to the layer guarding
    machine-global writes is this module's own failure mode one level in, and
    the stated threat model (an agent on a task branch) sets inline env vars
    routinely. The flag is an argument in command position and stays visible.
