def msg_send(to: str, text: str, kind: str = "note", ref: str = "") -> str:
    """Send a POLITE, non-interrupting message to another session's inbox.

    Use this for routine peer updates that should NOT interrupt — a worker
    reporting "PR drafted", an orchestrator nudging a sibling. The message
    drops into a durable inbox and only injects when the recipient's input box
    is empty and the pane is safe, so it can never clobber a human who is
    mid-typing. Delivery is at the next safe boundary (≤60s), not instant.

    Sending to a named session that doesn't currently exist still queues (the
    session may be about to be created), but the confirmation carries a
    warning: unless the session appears, the message dead-letters within a few
    minutes (and load-bearing kinds email the owner). Heed the warning — a
    gone recipient usually means a stale session name; check sessions_list.

    Prefer `session_send` ONLY when you must forcibly drive a session right
    now (it pastes + Enter immediately, overwriting any uncommitted draft).

    Args:
        to: Recipient session name, or "@all" to broadcast to every live
            agent session except yourself.
        text: The message body.
        kind: One of note (default), done, request, escalation, ingest.
            `ingest` is PASSIVE — never auto-delivered, so it never drives the
            recipient into a turn; it waits until they `msg_pull` it. Use it for
            "output ready to ingest" awareness signals (Briefing Mode): drop a
            passive pointer to a file the recipient reads on the human's cue.
            <!-- beta:voice_layer -->
            Also `voice` — the owner speaking through their voice buddy: active
            (it drives the recipient like a `request`) and escalatable, but NOT
            an interrupt; `escalation` remains the only kind that pre-empts.
            The buddy sets it; don't hand-pick it for ordinary agent mail.
            <!-- /beta:voice_layer -->
        ref: Optional machine-readable pointer (e.g. a report file path),
            surfaced as a typed field on the message — pair with kind="ingest"
            so the recipient can open the file without parsing free text.

    Returns:
        Confirmation of which sessions were queued — plus a warning when a
        named recipient doesn't currently exist — or an error.
