    """Create a worktree session (new branch + checkout + tmux session), optionally seeded.

    The spawn half of the worktree lifecycle (paired with worktree_status /
    worktree_list / worktree_remove). Creates a branch off origin/<base>, a
    worktree at ~/worktrees/<project>/<name>/, and a tmux session running an
    agent with the intrinsic safety etiquette for its role auto-injected.
    This is how a Briefing Mode anchor fans out correspondents.

    By default, the new session is recorded as the caller's child (so
    notify-parent / prompt routing resolve back to you) ONLY when project_dir
    is the same repo you're running in — a worktree spawned into a genuinely
    separate project becomes its own standalone root instead (#715).

    Args:
        name: Worktree/branch name (becomes the branch + session suffix).
        project_dir: Path to the git repo (default: server cwd).
        roles: Comma-separated roles STACKED on the intrinsic worker/reviewer
            etiquette (e.g. "correspondent"). Never replaces the safety rail
            (kind=worker or kind=reviewer; for kind="orchestrator" these
            REPLACE the default persona instead).
        base: Base branch to fork from (default: the repo's origin/HEAD).
        prompt: Optional first message — delivered once the agent is booted and
            ready (verified paste). Lets you spawn AND seed the task in one call
            instead of a separate session_send.
        created_by: Force a specific recorded creator/parent, overriding the
            default same-project-only inheritance above — e.g. to parent a
            worktree in a closely related project. Leave empty for the
            default behavior; note that empty here is NOT the same as the
            CLI's `--created-by ''` (force standalone) — there is currently
            no way to force standalone through this tool. Ignored when
            kind="orchestrator" and this is left empty — that combination
            roots by default (a durable orchestrator shouldn't inherit
            whoever spawned it).
        kind: Session role — "worker" (default: safety-railed, isolation/
            verify/draft-PR/notify, non-overridable), "orchestrator" (a
            durable, replaceable-persona project window instead of a
            subordinate), or "reviewer" (safety-railed the other way:
            adversarially reviews a sibling session's PR, never opens or
            merges one of its own; stays parented like worker, not rooted
            like orchestrator — for anyone who needs a local checkout to e2e
            a sibling's branch). Leave empty for the default.
