"""What the fleet DID — the awareness tier, and the ruling on what earns a voice (#1016).

The buddy could already be *told* things: ``msg send --to buddy`` reaches its
spool, and :mod:`~hermeswire.fleet_alerts` gives the machine's own detectors a
way to address it. What nothing did was emit the fleet's ordinary signals — a
session going idle, a scheduled task finishing, a toast shown to the owner,
anything spoken aloud through fleet TTS. So the buddy was blind to the two
things the owner most wants from it: it could not check in, and it could not
tell that the fleet had *already said* something out loud.

**The routing was never the hard part; the judgment is.** Everything in the
buddy's spool eventually gets SPOKEN — the notifier volunteers unread mail at a
gap (#962) and an ``escalation`` cuts across the buddy's own voice (#967).
There is no "quiet" kind. So a producer that pushes every lifecycle event into
the spool does not make the buddy aware, it makes it a narrator: a session that
goes idle after every conversational turn would buy an utterance every time.

Hence **two tiers, and the split is the whole design**:

**1. The LEDGER (this module's file) — awareness, never volunteered.** Every
event is appended here, and the buddy reads it only when asked ("what's been
happening?"). Nothing in it is pushed, so recording an event is free of the
interrupt question entirely, and the closed list of unprompted paths in
``instructions.VOICE_MODE`` stays closed — this adds a *pull*, not a fourth
push. This is also what makes the two audio surfaces one: every ``hermeswire
say`` is recorded here, so the buddy knows what the owner has already heard
and can decline to repeat it as news.

**2. The SPOOL (ordinary typed mail, via fleet_alerts) — for what a person
would actually want interrupting a gap.** :data:`ANNOUNCE` is that ruling,
pinned as data. It is deliberately short, and each entry has to answer "would a
colleague walk over and tell me this?":

- ``session_idle`` — only for a session somebody DELEGATED (a recorded parent,
  or a worker/reviewer role, or a worktree checkout). That is the event the
  owner described wanting: work they handed off has finished and wants a
  decision. A root orchestrator going idle is a conversational turn ending,
  not news, and announcing it would fire after every exchange the owner has
  with their own session — the failure that retires a channel.
- ``task_completed`` — a scheduled task finished. The owner did not watch it
  start and cannot see it end; this is the canonical "check in and offer a
  summary" event. A failed one is a ``request`` rather than a ``done``, by the
  same inherit-rule shape ``fleet_alerts`` already uses for dead letters: the
  fleet has made a judgment and the kind should carry it.
- ``toast_high`` — a ``notify-user --priority high`` toast. The one notify
  surface that already DECLARES urgency, and it declares it about a screen the
  owner may not be looking at. An ordinary toast does not qualify; it is
  ledger-only.

**Not announced, and on purpose.** ``spoke`` (an ``hermeswire say``) is never
announced, whatever it said: the owner already heard it, and a channel that
repeats audio back at you is worse than one that stays quiet. Portal lifecycle
churn (``session_created``/``session_closed``/``pane_died``) is ledger-only —
true, cheap, and not something anyone wants read aloud. Neither of those is an
oversight; both are answers.

**Nothing here interrupts.** No lifecycle event is ever an ``escalation``. The
interrupt tier stays exactly the two conditions ``fleet_alerts`` already ruled
on — the ones nothing clears without a human. An idle session is not burning.

**Throttled per subject, from the ledger itself.** A flapping session must not
be able to buy an utterance per flap, so an announcement is suppressed when an
announced record for the same (event, subject) sits inside
:data:`ANNOUNCE`'s cooldown. The check reads the ledger rather than a second
state file — the record is written BEFORE the emit decision, so there is
exactly one thing to keep consistent.

**Every entry point is best-effort.** A producer's job is to do its own job:
``hermeswire say`` must speak and the scheduler must finish its dispatch even if
this file is unwritable. Failures are logged into the fleet-alert event log
rather than swallowed, because a producer that cannot be distinguished from a
quiet fleet is the #885 shape.
