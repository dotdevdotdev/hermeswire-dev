"""``hermeswire.beta`` — the one implementation of the beta gate.

A beta feature ships on ``main`` and stays off until a user asks for it. The
flag VALUES live in :mod:`hermeswire.config` (``BetaConfig``); the MECHANICS of
hiding gated text live here, because the same mechanism now serves two
model-facing surfaces and a third would otherwise grow its own copy:

- **role prompts** (markdown) — resolved in ``roles.parse_role_file``;
- **MCP tool descriptions** (docstrings) — resolved by :func:`gated_doc`.

Both are text a model reads and a user pays tokens for, which is the property
that decides what belongs behind a gate. The MCP schema was missed on the first
pass: ``msg_send``'s description grew ~316 characters of voice-buddy prose that
loaded into every agent session in every install, ungated, while the commit
message asserted the role prompts were the only such surface. The lesson is in
this module's existence — one gate, one place, and a byte-identity proof per
surface rather than per file.

    Cached because the gate sits on a hot path: ``parse_role_file`` runs once
    per role per session launch, and an uncached read cost a full
    ``load_config`` — with its stderr INFO line — each time, taking ``roles
    list`` from 11ms to 242ms and printing 24 log lines, for a feature almost
    nobody has enabled.

    The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a long-lived process
    observes the flag state it started with, so turning a beta feature on takes
    the restart that ``config.yaml`` changes already take. An import-time
    surface like an MCP tool description is process-lifetime by construction
    anyway. :func:`reset_cache` exists for tests.

    **The precondition that makes the ON direction safe, written down because
    it is not visible from here.** A cached ``{"voice_layer"}`` outlives a
    config that has since said off — verified: gated prose keeps rendering
    until :func:`reset_cache`. That is unreachable today only because every
    in-process caller of ``load_roles``/``parse_role_file`` is a short-lived
    CLI module, and the surfaces that look long-lived are not: ``role show``
    and ``roles list`` shell out through ``run_hermeswire_cmd``, so each render
    happens in a fresh process that re-reads the flag.

    **A long-lived in-process caller would violate that**, and would do it
    silently — the gate would keep a feature ON for a user who turned it off,
    with no error anywhere. If you add one (a portal route rendering role text
    in-process, a daemon calling ``parse_role_file``), either call
    :func:`reset_cache` at the top of each request or give that caller an
    explicit ``enabled`` set. Do not discover this precondition by tripping it.

    flags are on now. ``__beta_enabled__`` records exactly that (and
    ``__beta_raw_doc__`` the pre-resolution text), which is what lets the
