"""Mints an OpenAI Realtime ephemeral session for the buddy (spike).

Shape verified against the current OpenAI docs (2026-08) and cross-checked
against a working implementation (DocumentScribe, whose request body was itself
derived from the ``openai-node`` SDK source rather than prose docs):

- ``POST https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets`` returns a
  short-lived client secret. ``value`` and ``expires_at`` are TOP-LEVEL;
  the session id is nested under ``session``.
- The browser then POSTs its SDP offer to
  ``https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls`` with the client secret as the
  bearer token, and gets an SDP answer back.

The API key never leaves this process — the client gets an ephemeral secret
that expires in minutes. That is the whole reason minting is server-side.

``OPENAI_API_KEY`` comes from ``~/.hermeswire/.env``, which ``__main__`` already
loads on every entry point. It is never read from ``config.yaml``.

#: Current GA flagship realtime model (2026-07). NOT "gpt-voice-2" — that name
#: does not exist; see the docs findings in docs/wiki/voice-layer.md.
#:
#: When this id rotates, verify the replacement with ``GET /v1/models/<id>``.
#: Do NOT verify it by minting a client secret: the client_secrets endpoint
#: does not validate the model and returns 200 with a usable secret for an id
#: that does not exist (measured 2026-08-06 — "gpt-voice-2" minted fine, while
#: /v1/models 404s it). A mint that succeeds proves nothing about the model.
DEFAULT_MODEL = "gpt-realtime-2.1"

#: Every voice the Realtime API accepts, newest first (docs, fetched
#: 2026-08-11). ``cedar`` and ``marin`` are the two the docs single out as the
#: newer, more natural ones; the remaining eight predate them.
#:
#: Enumerated here rather than left as "any string" (#1017) because the failure
#: mode of a typo is the model-id footgun one level down: the mint endpoint is
#: not a validator. Whether it rejects an unknown VOICE is **not measured** —
#: what is known is that it returns 200 for a model that does not exist, so a
#: successful mint proves nothing, and in a screenless channel the owner's
#: evidence for "cedarr" being wrong is a buddy that never speaks. Validating
#: locally turns that into a sentence with the list in it, before the key is
#: spent.
#:
#: Ordered, not a set: this tuple is what ``--help``, the picker on the page,
#: and the error message all enumerate, and the owner reads them in this order.

#: **The voice is fixed for the life of a realtime session.** The docs are
#: explicit: "Once the model has emitted audio in a session, the ``voice``
#: cannot be modified for that session." A ``session.update`` before the first
#: audio would take, but the buddy greets on connect (#963), so by the time
#: anyone picks a different voice the session has always emitted audio.
#:
#: That is why the picker on the page RECONNECTS instead of sending a
#: ``session.update``: the only honest mid-call voice change is a new session,
#: and the thing worth engineering is that it costs one click rather than a
#: kill, a re-serve and a manual reload. See :mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.client`.
