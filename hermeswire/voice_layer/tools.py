"""The buddy's tool surface — the allowlist and the one dispatcher (spike).

This module is the security boundary of the whole voice layer, so it is built
as a hard allowlist rather than a passthrough.

**Why an allowlist and not a generic ``run_hermeswire_cmd`` tool.** Voice adds a
failure mode the tool layer has never had: mis-transcription. "kill the worker"
and "kill the worktree" differ by one phoneme; so do most session names. A tool
that took an argv list and ran it would turn every transcription error into an
arbitrary command. Instead every tool here BUILDS its own argv from validated
parameters — the model chooses *which* tool, never *what runs*. A garbled
session name fails the pattern check and returns an error the buddy can read
back, which is the correct outcome: ask again.

**Reads are direct; writes go through the spine.** Anything routed through a
Claude session inherits damage-control hooks, worktree isolation, posture and
prompt routing. Anything the voice layer does directly inherits none of that,
so reads happen here and writes (:mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.write_tools`)
are declared specs gated below the model by
:mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.confirm` — the canonical one being a message to
a session that already has those guards. Which capabilities may ever appear
here at all is ruled by the tier audit in
:mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.surface`. There is still deliberately no escape
hatch: adding a capability means adding a tool, in a diff someone reviews.

Everything dispatches through the ``hermeswire`` CLI, which is the documented
single source of truth for session logic. The one exception is ``gh``, which
hermeswire has no wrapper for.

# Session names as the inbox defines them. Anchored: a partial match is how a
# fuzzy transcription would slip through.
#
# Every segment must START alphanumeric, which is doing two jobs the obvious
# character class misses (both caught by tests, both real):
#   - `-` is a legal name character, so an unanchored-start pattern accepts
#     `--help` — a name that reaches the CLI as a FLAG, not a value.
#   - `.` is a legal name character, so it accepts `../etc/passwd`.
# A leading separator is never a real session name, so requiring alphanumeric
# first closes both without narrowing anything legitimate.
#
# `@` is admitted inside a segment. Remote `name@machine` targets are out of
# scope (owner ruling, 2026-08-09) — but `@` does NOT mean
# remote, and a gate keyed on the character told the owner a true local name
# was unreachable. tmux accepts `@` verbatim (only `.` and `:` are rewritten,
# #878) and `inbox._SESSION_RE` admits it, so `ops@edge` is a creatable,
# addressable LOCAL session, and refusing it as "remote" is a confident
# falsehood the owner has no move from — the expensive failure with no screen.
#
# So the SHAPE is validated here and the RULING is enforced by liveness in
# `_session_arg`: a whole name tmux reports live is local by demonstration.
# What that refuses is precisely a name nothing local answers to, which is
# every genuinely remote target, said without claiming to know why.
