"""The FULL relayed utterance, on disk, because the pane cannot carry it (#1015).

The §4b body is capped hard — ``MAX_BODY_CHARS`` and its 160-char instruction
slot are not tidiness, they are the measured boundary past which the #689 heal
stops firing and a swallowed Enter wedges the message permanently. So a long
spoken request had exactly two possible fates and the shipped one was the bad
one: the recipient got ``"Treat it as a running list for anyt…"`` and acted on
the half it could see. Every relay in the first live voice session arrived that
way.

**A cap you cannot raise is not an argument for losing the text.** The pane is
one channel; the filesystem is another, and the recipient is an agent that
reads files. So the whole utterance is written here and the body carries a
pointer to it — the same shape ``ingest`` messages already use (``--ref``),
with the inline excerpt demoted to what it always actually was: a preview.

Three properties, each with a named failure:

- **Writing never raises.** :func:`write_relay` is called from
  ``Proposal.build_argv()``, which ``ConfirmSpine._dispatch`` runs *after*
  ``_proposals.pop()`` and *outside* the runner's ``try`` — a raise there eats
  the proposal with the approving utterance already spent, and the owner is not
  watching a screen (the ``_lead_safe`` lesson, same position, same cost). A
  failed write returns ``""`` and the message goes out as it does today:
  excerpt only, and the caller drops the ``--ref`` too, because a pointer to a
  file that is not there is worse than no pointer.
- **The pointer and the file agree.** The path is derived from the proposal id
  (:func:`relay_path`), frozen into the argv at propose time, and the body's
  ``full:`` slot is rendered from the path the write actually returned — never
  from a second construction of it.
- **The store is bounded.** Relays are small and permanent-by-default is a slow
  leak, so each write prunes entries older than :data:`RETENTION_DAYS`. Pruning
  is best-effort and never raises for the same reason writing does not.

The id in the filename is ``secrets.token_hex(3)`` from ``ConfirmSpine.propose``
— six hex characters, so the path is fixed-length and traversal-free by
construction rather than by validation. :func:`relay_path` asserts that shape
anyway, since it is what makes the sentence above true.

    that :func:`_prune`'s ``*.md`` glob can never collect.

    Atomicity is load-bearing rather than tidy: a partial relay read by the
