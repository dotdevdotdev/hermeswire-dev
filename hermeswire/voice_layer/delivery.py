"""Inbox delivery for sessions that have no tmux pane to paste into (spike).

``inbox.flush_session`` is built around one assumption that holds for every
session hermeswire has ever had: the recipient is a tmux session, so delivery
means *pasting into pane 0's input box*. Every gate in the drain encodes that
assumption — the gone gate (``live_sessions()`` is a tmux session list), the
empty-box gate, the stuck-in-box heal, and ``safe_deliver`` itself.

The voice buddy breaks the assumption: it is a real recipient with a real
identity, but its "input box" is a live audio conversation. Left alone, the
drain misreads it as a recipient that positively doesn't exist — tmux is
reachable and the buddy isn't in the list — so every ``msg send --kind done``
addressed to it dead-letters in ~5 ticks (``GONE_MAX_ATTEMPTS``).

Rather than fork the inbox (the explicit non-goal), this module is the seam:
:func:`adapter_for` answers "does this recipient want non-tmux delivery?" and
``flush_session`` consults it once, immediately after the cohort hold and
BEFORE the gone gate. Ordering matters in both directions:

- **After the cohort hold** — a report from a child the recipient is still
  waiting on belongs to ``hermeswire wait --children``, which reads it straight
  off disk. Spooling it first would consume it out from under that collection.
- **Before the gone gate** — that gate is the one that would kill the message.

Delivery here means *handed to the buddy's spool*, an append-only JSONL file the
voice layer reads. Nothing pushes into the conversation from THIS side: the drain
appends and stops, which is what keeps this module out of the interrupt question
entirely. The pull is no longer only on demand, though — ``client.py`` polls the
spool on its own clock and volunteers at a gap (#962), and escalation-kind mail
rides a relaxed gate (#967). "This slice never interrupts" was true of the seam
and stopped being true of the layer. See ``docs/wiki/voice-layer.md``.

Registration is data, not code: a session opts in by carrying ``delivery``
in its ``metadata.json`` (the #871 SSOT store). No existing session has that
key, so this module is inert for every session that exists today.

    already heard (an annoyance). Acking too much loses one silently — no
    dead-letter, no email, and in a voice channel no screen to notice on. So
    every refusal here fails toward re-reading, and the cursor never moves
