"""The buddy's browser client — WebRTC to OpenAI Realtime (spike).

Embedded as a string rather than shipped as a static file on purpose: adding it
to ``hermeswire/static/`` would put it one import away from the portal, which is
exactly the coupling a beta-gated feature must not create — a gate the portal
reaches around is not a gate. No packaging change, no portal change.

The flow, per the current Realtime docs:

1. POST ``/mint`` here → ephemeral client secret (the API key stays server-side).
2. ``getUserMedia`` → ``RTCPeerConnection`` with the mic track added, plus an
   ``oai-events`` data channel for the JSON event stream.
3. POST the SDP offer to ``https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/calls`` with the
   client secret as bearer; set the answer as the remote description.
4. On ``response.done``, any ``function_call`` items go to ``/tool`` here, and
   the result goes back as ``conversation.item.create`` +
   ``function_call_output``, then ``response.create``.

Two guards carried over from DocumentScribe's implementation, both of which they
paid for in bugs:

- **``responseActive``** — the server rejects a ``response.create`` while a
  response is in flight. ``server``/``semantic`` VAD fires its own responses, so
  ours must not race them.
- **Sequential tool dispatch** — one response can carry several
  ``function_call`` items; firing them concurrently makes their
  ``response.create`` calls race each other. Await each in turn.

Barge-in needs no code: the model is full-duplex, and ``echoCancellation`` on
the mic handles local speaker feedback the way any WebRTC call does.

Two things this page owns that the bridge cannot
------------------------------------------------

**1. Conversation-item time.** The confirm gate's ordering predicate ("the
approval postdates the proposal") is only well-defined on a single clock, and
the only single clock available is the ORDER OF EVENTS ON THIS DATA CHANNEL.
Wall-clock cannot work: the bridge can only stamp a transcript when
transcription *finished*, which is after the audio was *spoken* by exactly the
transcription latency the hazard is about — so an utterance spoken before a
proposal but transcribed after it would stamp as postdating it, and the
predicate silently inverts. So this page assigns a monotonic ``nextSeq()`` in
event order and stamps both sides from it:

- an utterance at ``input_audio_buffer.speech_started`` (the INTENT time, not
  the audio boundary — the commit fires at the END of an utterance, so ordering
  on it approves the barge-in case the gate exists to refuse; see
  :mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.transcript`). The commit is recorded too, and
  never compared;
- a proposal at the moment there is POSITIVE EVIDENCE its announcement was
  spoken — ``onSpoken``, whose ``how`` is ``"model"`` (a ``response.done`` whose
  transcript carried the text) or ``"fallback"`` (the browser voice said it).
  Either way the owner heard it, which is the quantity being stamped. Barge-in
  is native here, so anchoring at tool-call time would let an interrupting
  approval land on a proposal that was never stated.

  **#951 retired an earlier wording here, and the implementation under it:**
  "the ``response.done`` of the turn in which the buddy spoke it". Read as *the
  next ``response.done`` carrying any text* it let the announcer's
  own cancel steal the anchor, and it has no reading at all for the fallback
  path, which produces no model turn. A fallback-spoken proposal was then
  anchored by nothing and the owner's correct nonce got ``not_announced`` until
  the TTL — the fallback that GUARANTEES speech becoming the reason nothing
  could be approved.

The transcript forward is **awaited before any function call dispatches**
(``forwardChain``). Without that the two are independent ``fetch`` calls racing
each other, and tool dispatch is already detached from event ordering.

**2. Making a refusal audible.** Returning a reason string does not make the
model say it — a ``function_call_output`` is context, and the model then says
whatever it says. Worse, there is a path where nothing is generated at all:
``maybeCreateResponse`` declines while a response is in flight, so the output
lands and no response is created. That is not the unlucky path for a timing
refusal, it is the *likely* one, because a timing refusal fires exactly when the
owner has just stopped speaking and VAD is producing its own responses.

So refusals go through :js:func:`createAnnouncer` — cancel the in-flight
response, ``response.create`` with scripted instructions, verify against the
following ``response.done``, and fall back to ``window.speechSynthesis`` if no
spoken confirmation lands. **A refusal that always speaks in a robot voice beats
one that usually speaks in a nice one**; that fallback is what makes "silence is
unacceptable" structurally true instead of aspirational.

The announcer is kept as a standalone factory with injected ``send``/``speak``/
timer so it can be exercised under ``node`` against a fake data channel — the
acceptance criterion is about what reaches the CHANNEL, and a test that asserts
on a Python return value is green in exactly the scenario this exists to
prevent.

// The buddy's clock. Before this, client.py contained no polling of any kind —
// every action was downstream of the owner speaking, so the buddy could answer
// a topic but never open one. This is the one clock: poll the buddy's spool,
// and when a reply has arrived, volunteer it — through the injected
// `announce`, which is the page's ONE speaking path (#950). The notice is a
// bonus, never a contract: an empty spool produces silence, not chatter.
//
// Injected dependencies:
//   fetchInbox() -> Promise<{success, messages}>  PEEK — never advances the cursor
//   ackInbox(id) -> Promise<{success, acked}>  advance the cursor to EXACTLY id
//              (#970). The old bool ack advanced to the spool TAIL as it stood
//              at ack time, and the buddy acks only after SPEAKING — so mail
//              landing in that window was cursor-advanced past unread, with no
//              dead-letter and no screen to notice it on. #969 caught those in
//              a page-lifetime array and a page unload dropped them silently;
//              acking by id means there is nothing to catch.
//   announce(text, meta)   the page's announce() — no other voice exists here
//   canSpeak() -> bool     owner not speaking, no active response, nothing queued
//   canInterrupt() -> bool the RELAXED gate for escalation-kind messages

//              escalation is the fleet's already-made judgment (the same
//              typed kind that emails the owner on dead-letter), so the

//              never "how urgent does the model feel". Optional; absent
//              means escalations wait like everything else.
//   reRaise    the re-raise ledger (optional). Ticked only on a FULL-gate
//              poll with nothing fresh to say — a re-raise is politeness,
