"""The confirm spine — propose/confirm below the model (spike).

    This defends against **mis-transcription and against an approval the
    conversational model invented**, which is the stated threat. It does **not**
    cover every mis-transcription — a transcriber hallucination or an
    approval-shaped utterance meant for someone else is a real residual risk
    that the nonce narrows but does not eliminate. **A spoken retraction is caught
    only when it uses a word or phrase the grammar knows** — "let's not", "on
    second thought" and "I changed my mind" are not caught, and no word list
    reaches them. **A passed gate means the message was queued, not delivered,
    and not acted on.** The ``said:`` clause
    is evidence of what was **heard**, not proof of what was **said** — it is
    exactly as trustworthy as the local browser page, which holds the bridge
    token and can POST to ``/utterance``. It is **not** a security boundary
    against an adversary.

That paragraph is the guarantee, in full. **Widen it if you learn more; never
narrow it.** Anyone holding the microphone can approve anything the buddy
proposes. Do not paraphrase any of this as "the confirm gate protects writes" —
a guarantee that gets rounded up in the retelling is how an operator-facing
claim starts lying.

The "queued, not delivered" clause lives *here*, in the paragraph the wiki and
the docstring both carry, rather than only next to the spoken wording. This is
what a future reader quotes when they ask what the gate guarantees, and without
that clause they conclude "gate passed, so the write happened". It did not:
``msg send`` queues, and delivery is at the recipient's next safe boundary.

The ``said:`` clause caveat is there because §4b's entire purpose is that the
verbatim REQUEST utterance (captured at propose — never the approving one,
which is a nonce and stays inside the gate, #953) is evidence a recipient can
CHECK the paraphrase against, and a
recipient reading ``said:`` will treat it as what the human said. Anything
resident in the bridge's browser page holds the per-run bearer token and can
POST arbitrary text to ``/utterance``, so the evidence property is weaker than
a reader would otherwise assume.

The retraction clause is a stated residual rather than a to-do. Chasing "let's
not" / "on second thought" / "I changed my mind" is how this becomes the
unbounded denylist the filler list already taught us to reject — the phrasings
are open-ended and the list would never be done. What bounds the damage instead
is that a retraction the grammar misses does NOT approve anything by itself: the
write still needs the nonce, so the owner can simply not say it. The residual is
"you said something meaning stop AND then said the nonce anyway", which is a
narrower and much stranger thing to do than the clause's plain reading suggests.

Rationale, deliberately kept OUT of the quotable sentence above — stacking
mitigations into an honest limit is how it gets rounded back up: the residual is
small, because that field reaches only the attribution clause. ``--to``,
``--from``, ``--kind`` and the instruction are all frozen at propose, so the
worst available consequence is falsified *evidence*, never a redirected write.

The split, and why it is two halves
-----------------------------------

**(a) Proposal binding, below the model.** :meth:`ConfirmSpine.confirm` accepts
one argument: a token minted on a PRIOR turn by :meth:`ConfirmSpine.propose`.
The argv is frozen at propose time (:class:`Proposal`) and TTL-bounded. Nothing
between propose and confirm changes *what* runs, only *whether* it runs.

**Single-use means consumed on SUCCESS, not on attempt**, and that is
load-bearing rather than a detail. If a refused attempt burned the token, the
``pending_transcript`` refusal below would tell the owner to wait when waiting
cannot work — the spoken reason becomes a lie, and the owner is told to do the
one thing that cannot help. Refused attempts are rate-limited
(:data:`MAX_CONFIRM_ATTEMPTS`) instead.

**(b) The approval judgment, also below the model.** DocumentScribe leaves this
100% in the model: their anti-filler rule is a paragraph asking the model to be
strict (``voice/instructions.ts`` lines 42-46), their own comment says "there's
no code-level pattern match on 'yes'", and the stated fallback is "they tap the
card" — a click surface a voice-only user cannot reach (#748). The part we were
told to copy most carefully is the part that never worked hands-free.

Why the approval is a NONCE and not an approval grammar
--------------------------------------------------------

The first design here gated on "an utterance matching an approval grammar and
missing a filler denylist", and claimed that made two models fail the same way.
**That claim was false, and the mechanism was weaker than it looked.** The two
checks are not independent: both models consume the same audio. Three breaks,
none of which need the conversational model to fail at all:

- **Transcriber hallucination.** ``gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`` is Whisper-lineage,
  and confident short outputs on near-silence — "Okay.", "Yeah.", "Thank you.",
  "Yes." — are that family's best-documented failure. Three of those four were
  in the original filler denylist, which is the tell: **the denylist was
  enumerating a hallucination prior.** An unbounded denylist is not a
  mechanism, it is a list of the failures you have thought of so far — the same
  objection (b) raises against DocumentScribe's paragraph, one level down.
- **An approval-shaped utterance meant for someone else** — "yeah, that's
  right, anyway" to a person in the room. ``semantic_vad`` commits it.
- **One approval, two proposals.** The old condition was existential ("there is
  an utterance that postdates the proposal"), so one "yes" satisfied both P1 and
  P2. §4 names that exact failure: acting twice.

So the approval is a **spoken nonce**. The buddy speaks it in the proposal
("say **confirm tango** to approve"), and the grammar is ``confirm <nonce>``.
That **narrows** the first two — a nonce is not in a transcriber's prior, and
nobody says "confirm tango" incidentally — and **closes** the third, because the
nonce binds the utterance to one proposal (given uniqueness among live ones,
which :meth:`ConfirmSpine.propose` enforces). It also makes the filler denylist
redundant, which is the right shape. Cost: two words instead of one, still
hands-free, so T5 holds.

"Narrows", not "kills": a transcriber can still hallucinate, and a nonce word
can still appear in speech meant for someone else. Claiming otherwise would
contradict the honest limit above two paragraphs later.

**The false-REJECT half is priced too, and it is the half that bites.** A nonce
the transcriber renders inconsistently makes a CORRECT approval fail every
time, and the taxonomy then tells the owner to say it again — so they repeat and
fail identically. That is a livelock, and it is worse than the false-accept the
strictness was buying. Hence :data:`NONCE_WORDS` (one TRANSCRIBER RENDERING
each — which is a stronger claim than one spelling, and the difference cost two
of the original twenty words) and containment rather than whole-utterance
matching, with disfluencies skipped between the confirm word and the nonce.
See :func:`classify`.

The nonce carries a second property worth naming: **the owner cannot say a
nonce they have not heard**, which independently covers most of the barge-in
hazard that :attr:`Proposal.anchor_seq` exists for. The anchor is kept anyway —
two independent barriers, not one — but that is why the anchor is defence in
depth rather than the only thing standing between a barge-in and a write.

Bounded await, and three outcomes
---------------------------------

Fail-closed is right; fail-closed *immediately* is not. The conversational model
starts generating as soon as VAD commits the turn, while transcription is a
separate pass over the same buffer — so for a short utterance the confirm
plausibly beats its own transcript a large fraction of the time. Refusing
instantly would make every confirm cost two utterances, and worse: the first
approval then sits stale in the ring, so if the owner says "no, wait" and the
model retries, the gate finds the original approval and **writes after the owner
said no**. Fail-closed plus retry manufactures the window.

Hence: a bounded await on the ring's condition variable
(:data:`APPROVAL_WAIT_S`), and **three outcomes, not two** — ``approved`` /
``refused`` (a transcript arrived and did not match) / ``pending_transcript``
(the await timed out). The last two demand OPPOSITE behaviour from the owner
("say it again" vs "wait"), so collapsing them trains the owner to repeat into a
system that needed them to hold still.

The residual stale-approval window is closed from the other side too: a matched
utterance is SPENT (:meth:`TranscriptRing.spend`), and any denial committed
after the approval refuses the write.

Every refusal must SPEAK — and this module cannot achieve that alone
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Silence is the one unacceptable failure mode: the owner is not looking at a
screen, so a refusal they cannot hear is indistinguishable from not having been
heard, and they simply repeat themselves.

**Returning a reason does not achieve this.** A ``function_call_output`` is
context; the model then says whatever it says. Refusing to leave the *judgment*
in the model and then leaving the *announcement* in it is the same defect one
level up. So this module's job ends at producing a distinct, actionable
:attr:`Verdict.spoken` per outcome — and ``client.py`` owns the mechanism that
makes it reach the ear (cancel the in-flight response, scripted
``response.create``, verify against the following ``response.done``,
``speechSynthesis`` fallback). Neither half is sufficient alone.

No damage-control backstop on the sending — but the acting IS guarded
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Empirically confirmed (see the probe in ``tools/voice_dc_probe.py`` and the PR
body): the Bash-tool path is hooked and over-blocks on prose (#915), and the
bridge's ``subprocess.run`` path is not hooked at all. ``msg_send``'s MCP tool
is not in the matcher list either, so **no programmatic path to ``msg send`` has
damage-control coverage**.

The precise statement, and it has to be this precise because every shorter
version rounds up:

    **The sending is unguarded. The acting-on-it inherits the recipient's
    ordinary guards — which are guards on the OPERATION, not on WHO ASKED.**

"The acting-on-it is guarded" overstates twice. On coverage: the recipient's
hooks cover ``Bash``/``Edit``/``Write``/``Read``/``Grep``/``Glob`` and two MCP
tools, so a recipient acting through any other ``mcp__hermeswire__*`` tool
(``session_send``, ``pane_spawn``, ``msg_send``, ``worktree_*``) is not guarded
at all. And on kind, which matters more: **damage control cannot tell "the human
asked" from "the buddy asked" from "a mis-transcription asked."** It is not a
guard on the buddy's authority in any sense — the recipient is exactly as
guarded as it was before, and the buddy has added a new way to ask it things.

What actually constrains the buddy is the frozen argv and this gate. That is
worth stating plainly rather than borrowing reassurance from the recipient's
hooks.

#: Denial grammar (§3.1). Two tiers, and the split is the fix for a defect that

#:
#: **The root cause was normalization, not the word list.** ``_PUNCT_RE``
#: replaced punctuation with a SPACE, so ``normalize("don't")`` produced
#: ``"don t"`` and the ``dont`` alternative could never fire on real transcriber

#: transcribes as "do not" and "never mind". Three carefully written entries

#:
#: **The test lesson, which is the transferable part:** a reachability test over

#: failed is that normalization never PRODUCED those tokens. Testing a table's
#: entries against themselves proves the table, not the path into it — so the

#: and never the matcher in isolation.
#:
#: Single words that always signal retraction in reply to "say confirm <word>".

#: disfluency instead of punctuation.
#:
#: Enumerating these is safe under the closed-phrase rule for a reason worth

_FILLERS = frozenset({"uh", "um", "er", "erm", "ah", "hmm", "like", "you", "know"})


#: Ordered pairs. Order is the whole point: **"hold on" denies, "on hold" does
#: not** — which is the precise instrument for "confirm tango, the worker is on
#: hold", a measured false positive from the previous round. Bare-word matching
#: cannot express that distinction, which is why dropping the bare words was
#: right and dropping the retractions with them was not.
#: **Every entry is audited against the closed-phrase test**, and three failed
#: it — each measured DENYING a real approval:
#:
#: - ``("not", "that")`` — "it is not that urgent" DENIED while "it is not
#:   urgent" approved. It flipped on one added word, regressing the exact
#:   false-positive class the bare-word tightening fixed. "not that" is not a
#:   closed phrase, it is a fragment of open-ended speech.
#: - ``("back", "off")`` — "back off the throttle after" DENIED. An
#:   instruction, not a retraction.
#: - bare ``cancelled``/``canceled``, removed from the word list above — "the
#:   other task cancelled" DENIED. Ordinary past tense ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.
#:
#: ``("scrap", "that")`` and ``("hold", "off")`` are added: closed retraction

#: Words tolerated BETWEEN the two halves of a gapped bigram.
#:
#: **"Adjacent" was already a fiction and that is what made this a blocker.**
#: ``_denial_tokens`` strips ``_FILLERS`` before matching, so every entry in
#: this grammar has always been "adjacent modulo a skip set" — which is why
#: "never, uh, confirm tango" denied while "never ever confirm tango"
#: APPROVED. Shipping the pair as strictly adjacent stated a rule the matcher
#: did not implement, and the gap it left was the commonest intensifier in the
#: language. Also measured: really / once / actually / seriously, and
#: ``carries_denial("never ever confirm that")`` was False, so the
#: post-approval scan was blind to it too and the write EXECUTED.
#:
#: Closed class on purpose: degree adverbs, nothing else. An open gap ("any
#: word between never and confirm") would deny "I would never send that
#: without checking — confirm tango", which is an approval.
#:
#: **This enumeration sits on the FAIL-OPEN side, and unlike ``_FILLERS`` it
#: cannot be moved off it.** An unlisted gap word ends the run and the
#: utterance approves — "never absolutely confirm tango" would approve if
#: ``absolutely`` were missing. What bounds it is that the class is closed and
#: small; what does not bound it is anything structural. That is the honest
#: shape of this entry, stated rather than implied.
_NEVER_GAP_WORDS = frozenset(

)

#: Ordered pairs matched with a bounded, closed gap between them.
#:
#: ``("never", "confirm")`` closes the one place the "a missed retraction is
#: safe" fallback does not hold. ``never`` is kept OUT of the word list above
#: for good reason — it is among the commonest words in English — and the
#: general argument for tolerating that is "the write still needs a nonce, so
#: the owner can simply not say it". **That argument fails on this exact
#: utterance**: "never confirm tango" IS the retraction and it CONTAINS the
#: nonce, so the fallback the exclusion leans on is the very thing being
#: spoken. Measured before the fix: APPROVED, along with "you should never
#: confirm tango".
#:
#: Safe by the closed-phrase rule rather than by intuition: no genuine approval
#: places those two tokens in that order separated only by a degree adverb.
#: ``never`` anywhere else stays the ordinary word it was excluded for being —
#: "confirm tango, I never got the other one" still approves.
#:
#: ONE rule, one place: the pair is deliberately NOT also in
#: :data:`_DENIAL_BIGRAMS`. Two spellings of one rule drift apart, and the
#: zero-gap case is just this rule with an empty run.
#:
#: **The second half is ``confirm`` alone, not :data:`_CONFIRM_WORDS`, and that
#: is deliberate** — a reader will otherwise assume the pair tracks that tuple.
#: "never confirmed tango" approves, and should: the past tense is a STATEMENT
#: about what happened ("I never confirmed tango, did I?"), not an imperative
#: retraction. Only the bare imperative retracts, which is the same
#: exact-token reasoning that keeps ``waiting``/``waited`` out of the ``wait``
#: rule. Adding ``confirmed`` here would buy no retraction anyone speaks and
#: would deny ordinary speech about a past approval.
_GAPPED_DENIAL_BIGRAMS = {("never", "confirm"): _NEVER_GAP_WORDS}

#: Pairs that SUPPRESS a single-word denial.
#:
#: **Exceptions carry a HIGHER bar than denial words, and the asymmetry is the
#: opposite of the one that governs the word list.** For denial WORDS, prefer
#: tight: a missed denial is recoverable, because the write still needs a nonce
#: and the owner can simply not say it. That reasoning does NOT transfer here.
#: An exception SUPPRESSES a denial, so a wrong one means **the owner said no
#: and the write went** — not recoverable by declining to speak, because they
#: already spoke and it did not count. Same failure as the normalization
#: inversion, through a narrower door.
#:
#: So: for the word list, prefer tight; for exceptions, **prefer few**.
#:
#: Unconditional, and safe for a STRUCTURAL reason rather than a semantic one.
#:
#: The intuition is "don't forget X has no reading meaning cancel" — arguable,
#: and it survived eleven adversarial phrasings. But the checkable reason is
#: better: **an exception suppresses exactly the tokens of its own span** —
#: here the ``dont`` and the ``forget`` — and cannot mask a denial signal
#: anywhere else, because the word loop continues past it and the bigram loop
#: has already run. So its incompleteness has nothing to be incomplete ABOUT.
#:
#: **That sentence was false in the code for one round, and it is the whole
#: safety argument.** The masking loop computed ``len(trio or pair)`` — and
#: ``trio`` is non-empty whenever any token remains — so a matched TWO-token
#: exception masked THREE tokens and ate the word after its own span.
#: Measured: "confirm tango, don't forget — hold on" and "confirm tango, don't
#: forget, cancel the other one" both APPROVED, and ``carries_denial("don't
#: forget, wait")`` was False, so the post-approval scan was blind to it too.
#: The span is now taken from the rule that actually matched. An exception's
#: mask is only ever as safe as its length.
#:
#: That is the form a future exception should be argued in. Its one known miss,
#: "don't forget, on second thought skip it", contains no grammar word at all
#: and is the stated §3.7 residual, not a gap in this entry.
#:
#: ``("cant", "wait")`` is the second entry and clears the same bar. It is a
#: CLOSED idiom — "can't wait" has no reading meaning "hold off" — and it is a
#: measured false reject: "confirm tango, tell them I can't wait to see it"
#: DENIED on the bare ``wait``. Post-normalization ``cant`` is a distinct
#: token, so the pair is expressible without touching ``wait`` itself, and the
#: mask covers those two tokens only: any other retraction in the utterance
#: still denies, including a second bare ``wait``.
#:
#: Its price, stated rather than assumed: a hesitated hold spelled "can't —
#: wait!" normalizes to the same two tokens and is suppressed. That is a real
#: false accept, and it is accepted for the same reason the ``("hold","on")``
#: ordering is: the idiom is common in ordinary speech and the hold spelling is
#: rare, and a lone ``wait`` anywhere else in the utterance still denies.
#:
#: Note the anchor sits at the TAIL here (``wait``), not the head. An exception
#: must CONTAIN a denial trigger or it suppresses nothing; requiring it first
#: would be a rule about spelling rather than about what is being suppressed.
_DENIAL_EXCEPTIONS = frozenset({("dont", "forget"), ("cant", "wait")})

#: Trigrams that suppress a BIGRAM denial. "do not forget the other branch" is
#: the uncontracted twin of the ``("dont", "forget")`` exception above, and it
#: has to be listed separately because normalization does not merge the two
#: forms — the same reachability trap that made this grammar dead once already.
#:
#: This one is safe to enumerate for the reason the block below explains: it is
#: a CLOSED phrase, not an open class. "don't forget X" has no reading in which
#: a person means "cancel", so there is no next word to have missed.
_DENIAL_BIGRAM_EXCEPTIONS = frozenset({("do", "not", "forget")})

#: **There is deliberately NO conditional exception, and the reason is the
#: general rule this file has now learned twice.**
#:
#: A ``("wait", "for")`` exception was tried, guarded by "suppress only when a
#: real object follows". Two things killed it:
#:
#: 1. **The comment described a grammatical rule and the code was a denylist.**
#:    It tested membership in a closed list of hold-words, which is the exact
#:    shape the comment claimed to avoid. Measured, it failed BOTH ways: "wait
#:    for those / these / mine / both / everything" APPROVED (holds, so the
#:    write went out), while "wait for that build" DENIED (a real condition).
#: 2. **Inverting it does not work either**, and this is the part that settles
#:    it. The obvious repair is "default deny; suppress only on determiner +
#:    noun". But *"wait for a second"* (a hold) and *"wait for a build"* (a
#:    condition) are **structurally identical** — determiner + noun in both. No
#:    structural test separates them. Preventing the hold would need a list of
#:    time-unit nouns, and that list's incompleteness FAILS OPEN.
#:
#: The rule, which sharpens the filler-denylist lesson this file already carries:
#:
#:     **When a set must be enumerated, enumerate the side whose incompleteness
#:     is safe.** An incomplete list of words-meaning-HOLD fails open — an
#:     unlisted hold word approves a retraction. An incomplete list of
#:     structures-meaning-CONDITION fails closed — an unrecognized phrase denies
#:     an approval, costing a re-propose and nothing else.
#:
#: The problem was never enumeration as such. It was that this enumeration sat
#: on the side where being wrong WRITES.
#:
#: So there is no CONDITIONAL exception, and ``wait`` denies wherever the closed
#: ``("cant", "wait")`` idiom above does not mask it — and that is **correct
#: behaviour, not a tolerated false reject.**
#:
#: (This entry used to say "``wait`` denies unconditionally"; #987 added that
#: idiom, and the absolute survived here for a round after the code stopped
#: honouring it.
#: The wiki's copy was corrected first and this one was not, which is the same
#: drift with its polarity reversed: a claim pinned on one surface only is
#: proved on one surface only.)
#:
#: The reason is semantic rather than budgetary: the
#: write is ``msg send`` and it fires IMMEDIATELY. The buddy has no defer
#: mechanism at all. So approving "confirm tango, wait until you hear back from
#: the reviewer" would SEND NOW while the owner believes it is being held — a
#: silent divergence between what they said and what happened, which is strictly
#: worse than a re-propose. A "wait" clause attached to an approval is
#: **semantically unhonorable**, and the correct home for it is the INSTRUCTION,
#: frozen at propose ("tell the reviewer to wait until X"), where it is content
#: for the recipient rather than a condition on the send.
#:
#: The cost is also smaller than it looks: matching is on the exact token, so
#: ``waiting``/``waited``/``awaiting`` never fire. Only the bare imperative does.
#:
#: This holds **only while recovery is cheap** — see the newest-first binding in
#: :meth:`ConfirmSpine._judge`. When recovery was broken, this rule composed with
#: it into a dead proposal, and the ``denied`` line promising "say the phrase
#: again" became false.
#:
#: Do not reintroduce a conditional exception without a test that separates
#: "wait for a second" from "wait for a build" — and if you find one, it is a
#: genuine discovery, not a list.

# =============================================================================

#: Hard cap on the rendered body. **Measured in a real Hermes pane**, not
#: reasoned about — reproduce with ``tools/voice_heal_probe.py``.
#:
#: The binding constraint is ``flush_session``'s ``stuck`` test: a plain
#: substring match against the input box with NO #851 window path, so once the
#: box renders only a WINDOW of the message the #689 heal never fires and the
#: message wedges permanently — never healed, never dead-lettered, therefore
#: never emailed.
#:
#: Measured at 80x24 on 2026-08-06, by rendered-line length::
#:
#:     470  ->  box 482   stuck hit    ✓
#:     500  ->  box 512   stuck hit    ✓
#:     520  ->  box 532   stuck hit    ✓        <- last passing
#:     540  ->  box 480   stuck MISS   ✗        <- box starts windowing
#:     880  ->  box  16   stuck MISS   ✗        <- [Pasted text …] chip
#:
#: So the real boundary is a rendered line of ~520 chars, and there are TWO
#: failure regimes above it, not one: the box windows first, and only much
#: later collapses to the chip.
#:
#: 300 is the BODY cap, and the rendered line adds the ``[MSG from <sender> ·
#: <kind>] `` prefix and the ``  ⟨#id6⟩`` tail — 31 chars plus the sender name
#: with ``kind=voice``, so 63 for a 32-character worktree sender. That lands the
#: worst case at 363 against a measured 520, keeping ~30% margin. (Derived from
#: ``inbox.Message.render``'s format, not from a probe reading: the probe's
#: numbers describe synthetic bodies at chosen lengths, and quoting one of those
#: as "the worst case" is how this comment previously arrived at ~57 and ~385.)
#:
#: **Re-measured for #985, and the number deliberately did not move.** Slice 1b
#: changed both halves of the arithmetic: the ``<voice> `` prefix left the body
#: (8 chars back to the instruction/utterance/nudge budget) and the kind slot
#: went ``request`` → ``voice`` (2 chars off the rendered prefix). Both point
#: the same way — the worst rendered line fell 365 → 363 — so the headroom the
#: pane measurement bought grew slightly rather than shrinking, and no new
#: measurement is owed. The freed 8 body chars are spent where #981 finding 6
#: says they compete: the droppable reply nudge now fits in more cases. Raising
#: MAX_BODY_CHARS to consume the headroom would still need a fresh pane probe.
#:
#: **Re-measured for #1015, and again the number did not move.** The relay
#: pointer adds a ``full: <path>`` slot INSIDE this cap, so the worst rendered
#: line is unchanged at 363 — the pointer is paid for out of the excerpt and the
#: droppable nudge, never out of the margin. (363 is this arithmetic, against
#: ``WORST_SENDER_CHARS = 32``; a sweep over real bodies with the 33-character
#: sender the tests use reports 364. Same margin, one character of sender.)
#: The probe was re-run at 80x24 on
#: 2026-08-11 with the pointer riding, and the cliff sits where it did::
#:
#:     476  ->  box 488   stuck hit    ✓        <- last passing probed
#:     546  ->  box 480   stuck MISS   ✗        <- box windows
#:    1026  ->  box  16   stuck MISS   ✗        <- [Pasted text …] chip
#:
#: The recorded 520/540 boundary sits inside that 476–546 window, so it stands.
#: The round trip closed on the real shipped worst case (336 chars rendered):
#: pasted whole, ``stuck`` hit, ``finish_submit`` submitted, dedup found it.
#:
#: **The margin is deliberate and the measurement is pane-dependent.** The box
#: shows a bounded number of ROWS, so a shorter pane windows sooner than 80x24
#: did. Do not raise this cap to consume the measured headroom without
#: re-measuring at the smallest pane you care about.
#:

    CLI as a POSITIONAL — a leading ``-`` is parsed as a flag, a bug this repo
    has shipped twice (see ``tools._SESSION_RE``'s comment, which records both).

    **This function must be TOTAL, and that is a data-loss argument rather than

    raised. ``render_body`` is called from ``Proposal.build_argv()``, which
    ``ConfirmSpine.confirm`` runs **after** ``_proposals.pop()`` — the proposal

    version of the same bug — a flag-shaped body shipped with the guard gone.
    A guarantee that evaporates under a standard interpreter flag is not a
    guarantee. The regex is total and idempotent, ``render_body`` applies it to
    the finished body as the single enforcement point, and totality is swept in
    ``test_voice_kind.py`` over every dash/space/tab prefix up to length 4 plus
    a real ``-O`` subprocess.

    check the paraphrase rather than trust it — and can see it when the buddy
    got it wrong.

    **The request utterance, never the approving one (#953).** The approving
    utterance is ``confirm <nonce>`` by construction — content-free for the
    paraphrase check, and a leak of the nonce into the recipient's scrollback
    on every write. When no request utterance was captured, the slot is
    OMITTED: a slot whose expected content is empty must not survive.

    **The body never begins with a dash, and that is a safety property, not an
    accident of layout.** ``instruction`` is model-supplied and now leads the
    body, so it could reach the CLI as a FLAG rather than a value — this repo
    has shipped exactly that bug twice. Until #985 the ``<voice>`` marker
    guaranteed this for free by occupying first position; :func:`_lead_safe`
    now owns it deliberately, and the assertion below is the check on that one
    mechanism.

    Visible separators rather than newlines: scannable without being a wall,
    and without the wedging failure newlines cause.

    **Attribution is NOT in the body — it is the ``voice`` kind (#985).** §4
    rules that ``--from buddy`` alone is not enough: a recipient must tell a
    buddy-originated message from a human-typed one without reading carefully.
    Slice 1 satisfied that with a ``<voice>`` marker at the front of the body,
    explicitly as a stand-in, because the kind slot then said ``request`` and
    distinguished nothing. Slice 1b puts it in the slot that actually drives
    behaviour: ``inbox.Message.render`` prints ``[MSG from buddy · voice]``, so
    the distinguisher sits in the same on-screen position the marker held while
    also being the thing ``ESCALATE_KINDS`` and the drain read. No marker
    remains; a body that still carries one is stale text, not attribution.

    **The inline text is a PREVIEW, and the pointer is the message (#1015).**
    The caps here cannot be raised — they are the measured boundary past which
    the #689 heal stops firing — so a long spoken request had exactly two
    fates, and the shipped one silently dropped its tail into the recipient's
    lap ("Treat it as a running list for anyt…"). *full_path* names a file
    holding the whole thing (:mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.relay`), and the
    ``full:`` slot puts it on the delivered line, where an agent can read it.

    That slot is NOT droppable — it is the recoverability of everything the
    other slots clip, so dropping it under budget pressure would be dropping
    the fix. The reply nudge stays droppable and the excerpt shrinks; both are
    losses the pointer makes recoverable. It rides exactly when something WAS
    clipped — asked of the body as it ships TODAY, without the pointer's own
    cost (see the predicate below, which is self-fulfilling if asked the other
    way): a body carrying the whole utterance already needs no pointer to it,

    # the proposal, which is exactly when a response is in flight — the
    # `responseActive` branch. If the announcement of "I haven't finished
    # saying it yet" is itself swallowed by the response it is describing, the
    # owner hears nothing, waits, and the conversation deadlocks on two parties
    # each waiting for the other. The announcer must not special-case it, must
    # not skip the cancel for it (the cancel is gated on the in-flight mirror,
    # which is TRUE in exactly this state), and its fallback must stay
    # reachable — see client.py's createAnnouncer: the timer is armed before
    # anything that can fail, and TWO bounded deferrals may POSTPONE it,
    # neither of which can cancel it. BOTH are live in this state, which is not
    # obvious and was got wrong once. The in-flight leg keys on a response
    # created AFTER the announce (`sawCreate` is only set while the item is
    # current), so the response already in flight HERE cannot take it — but
    # that is not the only response in play: this outcome fires with
    # `responseActive` TRUE, so pump() cancels that one and creates OURS, and
    # the server's ack of our create sets `sawCreate` while the item is still
    # current. The owner-speaking leg (`maxOwnerDeferrals`, 3) never cared which
    # response is running. So at `fallbackMs` 6000 the announcer's own half of
    # the wait is its general worst case, 5 intervals — 30s — dropping to 4
    # (24s) only in the sub-case where our own create is never acked at all.
    # The deadlock sentence above was written against 2 intervals, 12s.
    #
    # And that half is not the whole wait (#997, closed by #1009). Both
    # deferrals are counted from the moment this refusal becomes `current` in
    # the announcer's FIFO, and pump() holds a queued item UPSTREAM of that
    # while a fallback utterance is still playing — bounded by that
    # utterance's own speaking budget (30s floor + 140ms/char, client.py's
    # speakingBudget). So in the one state where the browser voice is
    # mid-utterance when this refusal is queued, the worst case is one
    # speaking budget in front of the 30s above, and a coalesced five-reply
    # notice puts minutes there, not seconds. The interval arithmetic above is
    # complete only when nothing is being spoken.
    #
    # The deadlock argument survives the bigger number, and not by calling 30s
    # tolerable. It survives because a deferral is not a suppression: each is
    # counted per item and the re-armed timer eventually speaks with no
    # condition left to fail. And the leg that grew is the one that costs the
    # owner nothing — the owner-speaking deferral is taken only when the owner
    # IS speaking at the moment of the check, so it extends the buddy's wait,
    # not the owner's silence. An owner who stops talking stops that leg
    # deferring at once; the in-flight leg does not key on them at all, so at
    # most one unspent deferral still lands between their silence and the
    # speech. That bounds the silence anyone can be left in waiting for THIS
    # refusal at 12s, whatever the 30s above does to the buddy's own patience.
    # The pump leg does not add to it: it is taken only while a fallback
    # utterance is PLAYING — audio the owner is hearing the whole time — so it
    # too extends the wait and never the silence, which is why the deferral
    # was chosen over talking over it. A deadlock needs both parties waiting;
    # only one of them ever is.

#: How many tokens of the buddy's own line an utterance must reproduce, VERBATIM
#: and CONTIGUOUSLY, before :func:`is_buddy_echo` will call it an echo.
#:
#: This number is the entire false-reject budget of that rule, so it is chosen
#: against the collision rather than for tidiness. The denial triggers that
#: appear in :data:`SPOKEN` are short and ordinary — ``hold off``, ``hang on``,
#: ``dont`` — and they are exactly what a real owner says to retract. At two or
#: three tokens the rule would suppress a genuine "hold off" spoken over the
#: browser voice, and a suppressed retraction WRITES.
#:
#: Six tokens is past the point where a human utters a machine's sentence word
#: for word by coincidence: it takes ``hang on im already working on`` rather
#: than ``hang on``.
#:
#: **Guarded from BELOW only, and that asymmetry is deliberate.** Lowering this
#: is what the tests forbid, because it suppresses a real retraction and a
#: suppressed retraction WRITES. Raising it is the fail-closed direction — a
#: genuine echo stops being recognised, denies, and costs one re-spoken
#: approval — so nothing pins it from above. Do not read the pins as saying 6

def is_buddy_echo(text: str) -> bool:
    """Is *text* the buddy's own voice coming back through the microphone?

    ``speechSynthesis`` is outside the WebRTC path, so ``echoCancellation`` does
    not cover the fallback voice: what it says re-enters the mic and lands in
    the USER transcript. Approval is safe from that by construction — the
    fallback channel never carries a nonce (#953) — but :func:`carries_denial`
    is not nonce-gated, and several :data:`SPOKEN` lines CONTAIN denial
    triggers ("I heard you hold off…", "Hang on — I'm already working on that
    one", "I don't have anything pending…"). Echoed inside the approval→confirm
    window, one of those retroactively denies the owner's own approval and
    reports a take-back they never spoke (#992).

    **The discriminator is content, not timing, and that choice is the whole
    decision.** The obvious rule — "utterances transcribed while the fallback
    voice is speaking do not count as denials" — is unusable here: barge-in over
    the robot voice is the NORMAL way to retract in this channel, so that rule
    drops genuine take-backs and the write goes out. That is the acting-twice
    direction, which is strictly worse than the wrongful refusal it fixes (one
    utterance to recover, via the newest-first binding in
    :meth:`ConfirmSpine._judge`). A content rule has no such cost: it cannot
    fire on words the buddy never said.

    Two properties keep it on the safe side:

    - **The WHOLE utterance must be the echo.** A barge-in captured together
      with the tail of the buddy's line ("hang on im already working on that one
      no stop") is not a contiguous run of that line, so it denies. Only a clean
      capture of the machine's own words is suppressed.
    - **The enumeration fails CLOSED.** A short or garbled echo — the
      transcriber catching three words of it — misses :data:`_ECHO_MIN_TOKENS`
      and denies, costing one re-spoken approval. Nothing about being
      incomplete here can make a write happen.

    **What it does NOT cover, stated rather than implied.** :data:`SPOKEN` is
    the buddy's own taxonomy, so this covers only what THIS module makes it
    say. Attacker-influenceable text (a delivered message body, spoken verbatim
    by ``composeNotice``) is not in it. That text cannot reach this window
    today for a separate reason — ``client.py``'s ``canSpeak``/``canInterrupt``
    both require ``!confirmGate.outstanding()``, and the gate is closed from the
    moment a proposal is spoken until its terminal outcome or TTL, which is
    exactly the approval→confirm window. If that gate is ever relaxed, this
    function needs the spoken text fed to it rather than read from
    :data:`SPOKEN`, and the ``said-during-fallback`` mark stays the wrong
    instrument for the reason above.

        """Retire a proposal without writing — through the SAME claim (#990).

        "Never gated, because refusing is free" was true of the refusal and
        false of the SENTENCE. This used to pop whatever it found and say *"I
        heard you hold off, so I haven't sent it"* — including while a confirm
        holding the same token was inside the runner. That is the over-claim
        :data:`SPOKEN`'s ``in_flight`` line is deliberately worded to avoid, on
        the sibling path: the owner hears an affirmative "nothing was sent",
        with no screen to discover otherwise. #987 made confirm-vs-confirm safe
        by construction and stopped there; cancel-vs-in-flight-confirm is the
        same shape.

        **"A confirm holds the claim" is NOT "the write is going out", and
        conflating them re-committed the defect this issue is about** (review
        round 2). :meth:`_claim` is taken at the TOP of :meth:`confirm`, before
        the ≤2.5s await and before the judge, so the dominant occupant of
        ``_in_flight`` is a confirm still DECIDING. Refusing a cancel there with
        "it's already going out" is the same false statement, inverted: the
        measured shape is a cancel during the await, a confirm that then returns
        ``pending_transcript``, a runner never called, and a proposal the owner
        asked to drop still sitting pending.

        So the race is split on the thing the sentence is about:

        - ``_dispatching`` — the argv is inside the runner. This, and only this,
          is when ``cancel_in_flight`` is true.
        - ``_cancelled`` — a cancel that arrives while a confirm merely holds the
          claim WINS. It pops the proposal and answers ``denied``, honestly:
          nothing has been sent. The confirm re-reads the marker under the same
          lock immediately before dispatch and returns ``denied`` too, so the
          write does not go out behind the retraction.

        **The false-reject half, priced across all of it.** A cancel refused for
        the wrong reason leaves a proposal the owner believes is dead:

        - the announcement requirement is DROPPED (``require_announced=False``).
          A cancel of a proposal the buddy has not finished speaking must
          succeed — refusing it with ``not_announced`` would leave the proposal
          live for its full TTL over a technicality about who was talking.
        - **no cancel outcome leaves a live proposal behind.** The measured
          failure was "refused cancel, then refused confirm, wedged to TTL with
          no second word", and it came from refusing during the await; the split
          above removes it at the source, because that cancel now wins. The
          remaining refusals reach the owner only when the proposal is already
          gone (dispatched, replayed, failed, expired). Pinned as a property
          over every reachable cancel outcome rather than asserted here.
        - ``cancel_in_flight`` is a WAIT outcome with its own spoken line, and
          that line has to say what happens next, because the one thing the
          owner cannot do is take it back: the write is already going out and
          its real outcome is seconds away.
        - the shared claim's other refusals are TRANSLATED, not passed through
          (:meth:`_cancel_refusal`) — a cancel must never be answered with
          confirm-shaped advice to re-propose the write just retracted.

        ``ThreadingHTTPServer``, so the sequencing that made it safe is nowhere
        in the code. This module's standard is guarantee by construction.

        The marker also fixes what the second confirm was TOLD. Arriving while
        the runner was mid-dispatch, it found the proposal already popped and
        reported ``no_proposal`` — "tell me again what you'd like sent" —
        inviting a re-propose of a write that was in the act of going out.
