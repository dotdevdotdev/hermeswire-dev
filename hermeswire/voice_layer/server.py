"""Localhost bridge for the buddy's browser client (spike).

The realtime model runs in the browser over WebRTC (the transport OpenAI
documents for clients that capture and play audio directly). Two things the
browser must NOT do itself:

- **Hold the API key.** It gets an ephemeral client secret instead, minted here.
- **Execute tools.** Tool calls are dispatched in this process, through the
  ``hermeswire`` CLI allowlist in :mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.tools`.

So this is a deliberately tiny stdlib HTTP server with five routes. It is **not**
the portal and must never become part of it: it binds ``127.0.0.1`` only,
defaults to a non-default port, and mints a fresh bearer token per run that the
page is served with. A tool-execution endpoint reachable from anywhere else on
the network is precisely the unguarded surface this design is trying not to
create.

The loopback bind is **not** what keeps a remote page out, and reading it that
way is how the hole in #977 got here: the attacker never sends the packet, the
owner's browser does. A ``Host`` allowlist is the guard that actually
corresponds to the threat — see :func:`allowed_hosts`.

Two of the routes exist for the confirm gate's ordering:

- ``/utterance`` — the audio-commit boundary and the transcription model's
  output, both carrying the client's conversation-item sequence. See
  :mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.transcript` for why the sequence and not a clock.
- ``/anchor`` — POSITIVE EVIDENCE that a proposal's announcement was spoken,
  which is when the owner heard what they would be approving. POSTed from the
  client's ``onSpoken`` for BOTH of its paths: a ``response.done`` whose
  transcript carried the text, and the ``speechSynthesis`` fallback, which
  produces no model turn at all. An earlier wording tied this to "the
  ``response.done`` of the turn in which the buddy spoke it"; #951 retired it
  precisely because the fallback path has no such turn.

``ThreadingHTTPServer`` is load-bearing, not incidental, and in two directions:
a ``/tool`` request evaluating a confirm blocks briefly on the ring's condition
waiting for the ``/utterance`` request carrying the transcript it needs — on a
single-threaded server that is a deadlock — and the ring is therefore shared
mutable state across request threads, which is why it holds a lock on every
access.

    """Every ``Host`` value this bridge will answer on ``port``.

    Binding ``127.0.0.1`` does not make the bridge unreachable from the web,
    because the attacker is not sending the packet — the OWNER'S BROWSER is.
    A page on ``evil.com`` that rebinds its own name to ``127.0.0.1`` becomes
    same-origin with the bridge, fetches ``/`` (served with no auth), reads the
    ``TOKEN`` embedded in the page, and POSTs ``/tool`` with it. The one thing
    it cannot forge is ``Host``: the browser sets it from the address bar, so
    the rebound request says ``evil.com`` and the real client says a loopback
    name.

    **The false-reject half is the expensive one.** This is a screenless
    channel: a refused local client is not an error the owner reads, it is a
    buddy that stops working with no explanation. So the set is derived from
    how the client ACTUALLY connects, not from a guess:

    - ``client.py`` fetches ``/mint``, ``/tool``, ``/utterance`` and ``/anchor``
      as RELATIVE paths, so ``Host`` is always whatever is in the address bar
      — never a value the page chooses.
    - ``serve()`` returns ``http://127.0.0.1:<port>/`` and ``hermeswire buddy
      serve`` prints exactly that, which makes ``127.0.0.1:<port>`` the common
      case.
    - ``localhost:<port>`` is what a human types instead, and ``[::1]:<port>``
      is what a browser shows if it reaches for IPv6 first. The bind is
      IPv4-only, so that last one normally fails at TCP rather than here — but
      if it ever connects it is still the loopback, and refusing it would be a
      false reject for no gain.
    - A browser omits the port when it is the scheme default, so port 80 also
      accepts the bare names. The bridge never defaults there, but ``--port
      80`` is expressible and would otherwise refuse the only ``Host`` a
      browser can send.

    Matching is exact against this set (case-folded — ``Host`` is a hostname).
    Anything else, including a name that RESOLVES to loopback, is foreign:
    resolution is precisely what rebinding controls.

    What this does not close, and is not claimed to: on a multi-user machine
    any other local user can ``curl`` ``/`` and take the token, because
    loopback is per-host, not per-user.

        the voice once the model has emitted audio (see

        the buddy greets on connect, so there is no live call whose voice could
        be updated in place. The page therefore tears down and re-mints — the
        one click is the product; the reconnect is the mechanism.

        The logical clock the confirm gate orders on is assigned by the client,
        because the client is the only place that sees data-channel event
        order. Its ORIGIN cannot be: ``seqCounter`` is a page variable and
        restarts at 0 on every reload, while the ring and the spine live for
        the whole bridge run. A reloaded page therefore anchored its next

        (burning attempts on a question never asked) and, worse, an old "no,
        hang on" sat strictly-after the new match in the post-approval denial
        scan and retroactively denied every legitimate approval until 32 fresh
        utterances evicted it.

        ``/mint`` is the one event that happens exactly once per page load, so

        Reserved BEFORE the client secret, so an exhausted sequence space
        refuses without spending the owner's API key.

        Nothing is rejected and nothing is deleted, deliberately. A rejecting
        epoch guard pays its false-reject half by dropping an utterance from
        the owner's LIVE tab, and a dropped utterance in a screenless channel
        is a silent loop; ordering the epochs instead has no reject path at
        all. What it does not close: a forward that FAILS leaves ``high_seq``
