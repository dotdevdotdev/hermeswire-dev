"""The voice buddy's session identity — a name, without a tmux session (spike).

The buddy needs to be *addressable* by the machinery hermeswire already has:
``msg send --to buddy``, ``notify_parent``, cohort enrollment, dangling-PR
detection. All of that keys off a session NAME plus the metadata record at
``~/.hermeswire/sessions/<name>/metadata.json`` (#871's SSOT) — none of it
requires a tmux session to exist. So the buddy registers a record and an inbox
directory, and everything downstream works unchanged.

What is deliberately NOT recorded:

- **No conversation id.** ``conversation_ids`` is a chain of Claude Code
  conversation UUIDs minted by ``build_agent_command``. The buddy has no Claude
  conversation; writing a synthetic id there would corrupt the one store that
  is supposed to be authoritative rather than reconstructed.
- **No git identity.** ``repo``/``branch``/``worktree_path`` answer "where is
  this session working". The buddy never works in a checkout. Absent keys mean
  unknown, which is the truth.
- **No posture, no role prompt.** Those configure a Claude launch. There is no
  launch.

What IS recorded is the delivery adapter (so the inbox drain routes to the
spool instead of a pane) and ``kind: "voice_layer"``, so anything walking the
session store can tell at a glance that this record does not describe an agent.
