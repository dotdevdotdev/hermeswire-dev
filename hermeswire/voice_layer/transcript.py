"""The transcript ring, ordered by CONVERSATION-ITEM time (spike).

This is the foundation the confirm gate stands on, and getting its clock right
is the whole of finding Rv2.

Why not wall-clock, and why that is not a tolerance problem
-----------------------------------------------------------

The obvious design stamps each utterance when the bridge *receives* the
forwarded ``conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed``. That is
when transcription **finished**, not when the audio was **spoken**, and the gap
between them is exactly the transcription latency the whole timing hazard is
about. An utterance spoken BEFORE a proposal but transcribed AFTER it stamps as
postdating it — **the predicate silently inverts**.

Widening a tolerance does not fix that, because the two sides are not the same
quantity: a receipt time compared against an intent time. The fix is to compare
two quantities that ARE the same, and the realtime session already provides one
— the order of items on the data channel.

So the ring is ordered by a **logical clock**: a monotonically increasing
sequence the client assigns in data-channel event order (see
``client.py``'s ``nextSeq``). Both sides of the comparison come from that one
ordered stream:

- an utterance is stamped at its ``input_audio_buffer.speech_started``;
- a proposal is anchored on positive evidence that its announcement was SPOKEN —
  the client's ``onSpoken``, which fires for the model path and for the
  ``speechSynthesis`` fallback alike (see ``confirm.Proposal.anchor_seq``). An
  earlier wording here said "the ``response.done`` of the turn in which the
  buddy spoke it"; the fallback produces no model turn, so #951 retired it.

"The approval postdates the proposal" then means
``speech_started_seq > anchor_seq``: one integer comparison, on one clock, in
conversation order. No skew, no latency, nothing to tune.

**Why speech-START and not the audio commit.** This is subtle and the obvious
choice is wrong in a way that reopens the exact hole the clock change exists to
close. ``input_audio_buffer.committed`` fires at the **end** of an utterance.
The barge-in case is the owner beginning to speak DURING the buddy's proposal
and finishing after it — so speech-start predates the proposal's
``response.done`` while the commit postdates it. Ordering on commit therefore
**approves the barge-in**: an approval for a proposal the owner never heard
stated. Speech-start is the intent time; the commit is not.

The commit event is still needed, for a different job: it is what binds the
``item_id`` used by the transcript event, and it is recorded (``commit_seq``) so
the ordering choice can be inspected rather than assumed. Both times live on the
entry; only ``speech_started_seq`` gates.

Ordering of the two forwards
----------------------------

The commit event and the transcript for the same ``item_id`` arrive as two
separate ``POST /utterance`` calls, and the confirm arrives as a third
(``POST /tool``). The client awaits the transcript forward before dispatching
any function call (Rv2c), but the bridge must not *depend* on that: a commit
that has not arrived yet leaves the entry absent rather than mis-stamped, and a
transcript arriving with no prior ``speech_started`` is recorded ``estimated``
and is never usable as an approval. (The COMMIT is not what decides that, and
saying so here described a gate this module deliberately does not have —
:meth:`TranscriptRing.transcribe` flags ``estimated`` on a missing
``speech_started_seq``, because that is the one the ordering predicate reads.)
Failing closed there is deliberate — if the ``speech_started`` events stopped
arriving, confirms stop working loudly rather than silently losing their
ordering guarantee.

Two shapes hide under "the transcript never came", and only one needs a clock
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

:meth:`TranscriptRing.unheard_between` is the denial half of the timing
asymmetry: an utterance whose ``speech_started`` was recorded but whose
transcript has not landed holds the gate at ``pending_transcript``. Left
unbounded, one such entry refuses every confirm for a proposal's whole TTL
(#989). The obvious repair — a flat wall-clock age — is wrong, because the name
covers two failures with opposite prices:

**1. Transcribed, but empty.** A cough that the transcription model renders as
``""`` produced a transcript EVENT; ``complete`` is False only because the text
is blank. This needs no clock at all. The gate's question is "did the owner say
something we cannot yet read", and an empty transcript positively answers it:
they said nothing readable, so there is no denial hiding in it. Hence
:attr:`Utterance.transcribed` — a transcript ARRIVED — which is what this method
filters on. ``complete`` still gates :meth:`TranscriptRing.after`, where the
question is different (can this text approve), and an empty utterance answers
that one no.

**2. Never transcribed at all.** Here there genuinely is an unread utterance and
only time can retire it — and the bound must key on whether the audio buffer
CLOSED, not on age alone. With a ``commit_seq`` the utterance is over and the
transcript is simply overdue: a few seconds of ASR latency is the whole budget
(:data:`UNHEARD_COMMITTED_GRACE_S`). Without one the owner may still be
speaking, and the bound has to exceed a plausible utterance
(:data:`UNHEARD_OPEN_UTTERANCE_S`) or the gate stops waiting for a take-back the
owner is in the middle of saying — the acting-twice direction, not a wait.

**One flat age cannot price both.** Set to the committed grace it truncates a
long spoken denial; set to the open bound it leaves a cough holding the gate for
a minute. That is why there are two constants and why the split is on the commit
rather than on the age.

Thread safety
-------------

The bridge is a ``ThreadingHTTPServer`` and the ring is shared mutable state
across request threads (Rv2c). Every read and write holds the lock. The lock is
also the mechanism for :meth:`TranscriptRing.await_utterance_after`: a ``/tool``
thread evaluating a confirm blocks on the condition until an ``/utterance``
thread notifies it. That is not a workaround for threading — it is how the
bounded await in §3.3 is implemented at all.
