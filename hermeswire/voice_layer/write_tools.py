"""The buddy's writes: DECLARED specs, one generated propose/confirm/cancel path.

Q2 is settled as **handoff, not a tool**. The buddy does not build a
``worktree_create`` argv, does not create sessions, does not own a checkout and
does not appear in the topology. Its canonical write is
``hermeswire msg send --to <session> --from <buddy> --kind request <body>``,
addressed to a real Hermes session which DOES have damage-control hooks,
posture, worktree isolation and prompt routing.

That distinction is the precise one, and the loose version contradicts itself:
**the sending is unguarded; the acting-on-it is guarded.** No programmatic path
to ``msg send`` has damage-control coverage — not this ``subprocess.run``, and
not ``mcp__hermeswire__msg_send`` either, which is absent from the ``PreToolUse``
matcher list. What the RECIPIENT does with the message runs inside a real Hermes
session with hooks. That is the whole point of handoff, and it is why the
boundary holds by construction rather than by discipline.

**Why declarations and not triples (#966).** Each write used to be three
hand-written functions with a hand-frozen ``argv_prefix``. Ten writes that way
is nine more triples and nine more chances to freeze the argv wrong — and a
mis-frozen argv is exactly how a model-supplied string reaches the CLI. A
write is now a :class:`WriteSpec`: name, params schema, a ``freeze`` function
that validates the model's arguments into a :class:`FrozenWrite`, and the
spoken templates. :func:`gated_triple` generates the propose/confirm/cancel
tools from it, so the invariants live in ONE place:

- the WHOLE argv is frozen at propose time — every model-supplied element
  inside ``freeze``, plus the one element only the spine can know: the
  ``--ref`` naming this proposal's relay file, which is a pure function of the
  id ``ConfirmSpine.propose`` mints (#1015). Nothing is frozen later;
- a proposal is single-use and consumed on success (the spine);
- the approving utterance never reaches the body (#953 — the spine);
- ``render_body``'s leading-dash assertion guards every body-carrying write;
- an argv-only write (``append_body=False``) may contain NO free text — every
  element must come out of a validator, which ``freeze`` is the one place to do.

**The tier audit lives in** :mod:`~hermeswire.voice_layer.surface` — which
capabilities are reads, which are writes and at what grade, and which are
excluded permanently. Read it before adding a spec here.

**On the pull toward a bootstrap escape hatch.** When nothing is live there is
an obvious, tempting fix: let the buddy start one orchestrator, just this once,
so the handoff has somewhere to go. That is session-creation semantics through
the back door and it is not built here. :func:`_require_live` refuses and the
buddy says "nothing is listening" out loud, which is a correct and useful
spoken answer (spec §5).

    the write proceeds and the ordinary CLI path reports what it finds. Only
    POSITIVE knowledge (tmux answered, the target is not in the list) refuses.

    *cannot* names what the buddy cannot do instead, spoken verbatim.

    The name is compared WHOLE. It used to be compared as ``split("@")[0]``,
    from when the voice pattern admitted ``name@machine``: the bare half of a
    remote name was checked against LOCAL tmux, so a remote session got either
    a false "nothing is listening" or — worse — a pass, on the strength of a
    local session that happens to share its name. Remote targets are out of
    scope (owner ruling, 2026-08-09), but nothing refuses the ``@`` SYNTAX —
    that was the first attempt at the ruling and it was itself a false
    statement, since ``ops@edge`` is a creatable, addressable LOCAL session
    (see surface.py, "Remote ``name@machine`` targets are out of scope"). What
    ships is a LIVENESS gate: ``tools._session_arg`` checks the shape, then
    refuses any whole name containing ``@`` that local tmux does not report
    live. So a name reaching here is local by DEMONSTRATION — and the bare half
    before the ``@`` is exactly the string that was never the thing
    demonstrated, which is why splitting it could only re-open that gap. The
    one case that demonstrates nothing is an unreachable tmux, where both that
    gate and this one refuse nothing (spec §5) rather than either guessing.
