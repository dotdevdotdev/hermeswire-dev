"""Research dropbox resolver for Briefing Mode.

Correspondents file their deep reports into a per-anchor directory under
``~/.hermeswire/research/<anchor-session>/``. The anchor pulls passive ``ingest``
messages whose typed ``ref`` field points at those files, then reads them on the
human's cue. This module is the single source of truth for that path — so the
roles, CLI, and MCP don't hand-compute it (mirrors ``inbox.INBOX_ROOT`` and
``usage_limit`` state paths).
