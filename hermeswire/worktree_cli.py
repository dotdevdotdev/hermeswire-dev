"""``hermeswire helper`` — a worker session with NO isolation (#838).

A worker pane's one genuine advantage over a worktree session is that it
shares the orchestrator's checkout: no ``git worktree add``, no branch, no
directory, instant. Everything else about a pane is a regression — no msg
inbox (#834), no voice, a headless exit-summary instead of report-back.

This verb reproduces that one advantage on a real *session*. The cwd IS the
caller's own working tree; creation performs zero git operations. Everything
else — msg inbox, voice, prompt routing, cohort enrollment, portal
visibility — comes free from being an ordinary session.

**Not a creation path.** :func:`cmd_helper` creates nothing. It resolves a
directory, derives a session name, and delegates to ``session_cli.cmd_new``
— the one session-creation path — exactly as ``cmd_orchestrator`` delegates
to ``cmd_worktree``.

Two things make sharing a checkout safe:

1. **The guard is declared past, not disarmed.** ``session_cli.cmd_new``'s
   shared-working-dir guard refuses to put a second agent in a tree that
   already has one, because two agents in one working tree is a real footgun
   (see the ``shared-checkout`` role for the concrete list). ``helper`` is
   *literally* the sentence "put a second agent in this tree", so it passes
   ``allow_shared_dir=True`` — the same posture as ``services.py``
   ("registering a service is explicit intent") and #857's dispatch
   derivation. Deliberately NOT ``--force``, which would additionally
   kill-replace a live same-name session. The guard stays fully armed for
   interactive ``hermeswire new``.
2. **The ``shared-checkout`` role states the constraint.** Read and edit
   freely — editing the shared tree is the entire point — but never mutate
   git state (checkout/commit/stash/reset/branch/pull/rebase), because that
   rewrites the tree under the co-resident agent or sweeps its in-flight
   edits into your commit.

Nothing is written to the worktree registry: this session creates no
directory and no branch, so there is no git resource for
``--list``/``--prune``/``--remove``/``--dangling`` to track. ``hermeswire
kill`` reclaims all of it.
