"""Custom service registry, health checks, and watchdog policy.

A custom service is a long-running hermeswire session registered in
``services.custom`` in ``~/.hermeswire/config.yaml``. This module is the
single source of truth for service lifecycle logic — the CLI commands
(``hermeswire services ...``), ``hermeswire up``, ``hermeswire doctor``, and
the portal's autostart + watchdog all call into it.

State: ``~/.hermeswire/services-state.json`` records services the user has
manually stopped (``hermeswire services down``) so neither ``up --all`` nor
the watchdog resurrects them.

    """Run a plain process under tmux, detached. Idempotent.

    tmux IS the supervisor here, and that choice is what keeps a process
    service's output off any world-readable surface: tmux captures stdout and
    stderr into the pane's scrollback, which lives in the tmux server's memory
    and is reachable only through the per-user socket dir ``/tmp/tmux-<uid>``
    (mode 0700). Nothing is redirected to a file — deliberately. A wrapper that
    is careful in its own code and then tees stdout into a log has not solved
    the problem, and the same standard #887 holds ``~/.hermeswire`` and
    ``portal.token`` to applies here: owner-only or not at all.

    What this does NOT hide is ``command`` itself: it lands in the process
    table, where every local user can read it. Secrets belong in
    ``~/.hermeswire/.env``, never in a service's argv — see
    ``command_secret_risk``.

    **A created pane is not a surviving process.** ``tmux new-session``
    returning 0 says a pane was made; the command inside it may already have
    exited. Reporting that as "started" produced the worst shape available: a
    success line, a ``[!!] unhealthy`` from doctor one second later prescribing
    the command that had just claimed success, and the process's own stderr
    gone with the pane. So the spawn is three steps rather than one — a
    placeholder, ``remain-on-exit on``, then the real command via
    ``respawn-pane`` — and then the pane is re-read after a grace period.

    The ordering is the point and is why a placeholder exists at all: setting
    the option AFTER launching the real command is a race a fast-dying process
    wins, and it is exactly the fast-dying processes whose reason we need.

    **The placeholder must never outlive the spawn.** Steps 2 and 3 run against
    a session step 1 just created, so a failure there is not the benign
    "someone else got there first" the old handler assumed — it is our own
    placeholder, alive and running ``sleep 3600``. ``pane_dead`` cannot tell
    that from a healthy process, so leaving it would report a sleep loop as a
    running service: the same false all-clear one costume over. ``already
    running`` is therefore reachable only when the session genuinely
    PRE-EXISTED this call.
