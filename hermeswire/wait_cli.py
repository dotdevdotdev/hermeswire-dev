"""``hermeswire wait`` — block on a fan-out's children (#852).

The join primitive a parent calls after fanning out. Blocking inside a tool
call is not idle, so the idle hook never fires: the parent is never prompted
for a roll-up it can't write yet, and is never ``/exit``-ed while its children
are still working. See :mod:`hermeswire.cohort`.

def cmd_wait(args) -> int:
    """Block until the calling session's cohort resolves (or time runs out).

    Bounded (``--timeout``) and re-callable, so a fan-out longer than the
    calling harness's tool timeout just loops. Each pass collects any report
    waiting in the inbox, kills the child it collected (collect-then-kill: the
    reverse order dead-letters the report and emails the owner), and marks a
    child whose session already vanished. Children still outstanding when the
    cohort deadline passes are killed and returned as failures so the parent's
    summary names them instead of the run leaking a live session.

    Exit status is 0 when the cohort resolved, 1 when this call returned with
    children still pending — a caller looping on it can just re-run.
