"""``hermeswire activity`` — what the fleet has been doing (#1016).

The read side of :mod:`~hermeswire.fleet_activity`. It exists as a CLI verb for
two reasons, and the second is the load-bearing one:

1. "CLI is the single source of truth" — a store readable only from inside the
   process tree that writes it is exactly the shape that rule exists to prevent.
2. The voice layer dispatches **only** through the CLI (see
   ``voice_layer/tools.py``), so without this verb the buddy could not read the
   ledger that was built for it.

Read-only, by construction: nothing here writes. Producers record from inside
the surfaces that generate the events (idle, say, toast, scheduled run), never
from a verb an agent could be talked into calling.
