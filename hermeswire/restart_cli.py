"""``hermeswire restart`` — relaunch a session IN PLACE, same conversation (#871).

The verb that was missing. Restarting a session onto new code (a `rebuild`, a
reboot, a wedged agent) used to mean picking the least-wrong neighbour:

- ``recreate`` force-removes the worktree and ``rm -rf``s the directory, then
  cuts a fresh timestamped branch. It destroys uncommitted work by design.
- ``history resume`` always forks into a NEW tmux session, leaving the old one
  behind and the branch/PR mapping pointing at a session nobody is in.
- ``kill`` + ``new`` loses the conversation entirely, and — before #871 — the
  role with it, since the role prompt lived in a temp file macOS GC'd.

What this does instead: ``/exit`` the session, REGENERATE its launch flags from
the recorded ``roles``/``posture``/``model``, and relaunch at the same cwd with
``--resume`` so the same conversation continues in the same tmux session.

**Regenerate, never re-evaluate.** The launch line is rebuilt through
``build_agent_command``. The tmux session env holds the previous one in
``HERMESWIRE_LAUNCH_CMD``, and re-``eval``ing that is the single most tempting
wrong move here. The recorded Hermes session id is only ever passed to
``--resume`` (which continues the SAME session — no new id is minted).

**A recorded id does not guarantee a resumable conversation.** ``history.
locate_conversation`` probes ``~/.hermes/state.db`` for the id before
resuming, and this verb degrades deliberately when it isn't there — fresh
conversation, role intact, and it SAYS SO. See :func:`resolve_resume_target`.
