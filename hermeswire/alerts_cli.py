"""``hermeswire alerts`` — who hears the machine's own detectors (#982).

Fleet detectors (expired login, usage-limit park, dead-lettered report-backs, a
root pane blocked with nowhere to route) have always been able to email the
OWNER. ``fleet_alerts`` lets them address a SESSION as typed mail instead, and
this is the surface that turns that on: without a CLI verb the subscription API
would be reachable only from inside the tree that calls it, which is precisely
the shape "CLI is the single source of truth" exists to prevent.

Subscription is a renewable **lease**, so ``list`` reports the expiry rather
than a boolean: a subscriber that stopped renewing has silently stopped
hearing anything, and that is a state an operator has to be able to see.
