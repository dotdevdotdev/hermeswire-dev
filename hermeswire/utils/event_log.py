"""Size-capped append for the append-only ``*-events.jsonl`` debug logs.

Single source of truth for the five event-log writers (inbox, prompt-router,
usage-limit, session-context, scheduler). Each writer used to be a bare
``open(path, "a")`` with no size bound, so a long-lived self-host box would
accumulate unbounded debug history (#499). They all now route through
:func:`append_event`, which rolls the file once it crosses a size threshold,
keeping a bounded number of ``.1``/``.2`` backups.

The on-disk line format is unchanged: one ``json.dumps(record) + "\n"`` per
event. Rotation only renames whole files; it never rewrites a line.

Both knobs are env-configurable (host-side, no rebuild) with sane defaults:

- ``HERMESWIRE_EVENT_LOG_MAX_BYTES`` — roll once the active file would exceed
  this many bytes. Default 5 MiB. ``0`` (or negative) disables rotation.
- ``HERMESWIRE_EVENT_LOG_BACKUPS`` — how many rolled files to retain
  (``.1`` .. ``.N``). Default 3. ``0`` keeps no backups (oldest is dropped).
