"""Live-pane round trip for the §4b body: does the #689 heal actually fire?

**Why this exists even though the mechanism is unit-tested.** The unit tests
assert against the real functions with a real captured pane geometry, and that
proves the mechanism. It does not prove the behavior: a green test proves the
FIXTURE's shape. This is the highest-consequence failure in the slice — if the
heal does not fire, a buddy write whose Enter was swallowed wedges permanently
(never healed, never dead-lettered, therefore never emailed) on a channel whose
entire justification is that the owner is not watching a screen.

So this pastes a real rendered message into a REAL Claude Code pane, leaves the
Enter unsent (the swallowed-Enter state), and then runs the actual heal.

Also measures the two caps §4b says to measure rather than guess:

  1. ``flush_session``'s ``stuck`` test is a plain substring match against the
     box content with NO #851 window path, so a single-line body long enough
     that the box renders only a WINDOW of it fails the heal the same way a
     multi-line one does. Where is that boundary, in a real box?
  2. ``VERIFY_SCROLLBACK_LINES`` bounds the dedup capture. A needle that
     scrolls partly out returns False → stays pending → re-pastes → duplicate
     delivery, i.e. "the orchestrator acts twice".

Isolation: creates its OWN throwaway tmux session in this worktree, at a fixed
80x24 so the numbers are reproducible, and kills it at the end — including on
failure. It never touches another session.

**Repoint the ``dependencies`` line above at the checkout you are measuring.**
PEP 723 needs a literal path, and the probe measures whatever that install
holds — running it from a worktree while it points at ``~/projects`` measures
main's renderer under the worktree's name.
