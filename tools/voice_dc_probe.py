"""Empirical damage-control probe for the voice layer's write path.

Answers one question with measurements rather than with an argument about
``settings.json``: **is the buddy's write path guarded?**

Four probes, because either direction alone is consistent with the wrong
conclusion:

  A  the hook, fed a synthetic PreToolUse payload for a ``msg send`` whose
     BODY discusses a guarded operation                        → expect BLOCK
  B  the identical argv via ``subprocess.run`` from plain Python — exactly what
     ``mcp_core.run_hermeswire_cmd`` does from the bridge        → expect exit 0
  C  control: an innocuous ``msg send`` through the hook        → expect ALLOW
  D  control: a genuinely destructive command through the hook  → expect BLOCK

Without C, probe A does not distinguish "the rule fired" from "the hook refused
for some other reason". Without D, it does not distinguish "the rules work" from
"everything is blocked".

Two traps this script exists to avoid, both of which cost real time:

1. **Launching the probe through Claude Code's Bash tool blocks the probe.**
   The hook matches the guarded prose in the command line (#915), so the probe
   never runs. Hence: the pattern is assembled from FRAGMENTS here, in a file,
   and never appears on a command line.
2. **Running the hook under bare ``python3`` returns exit 2 with
   "pyyaml unavailable — cannot load rules".** That is the FAIL-CLOSED path, not
   a rule firing, and exit 2 is the same code a real block returns. Recording it
   as "the rule fired" is a false positive of exactly the
   verified-against-the-wrong-thing class this repo keeps hitting. So the hook
   is invoked through its own ``uv run --script`` shebang, and any result whose
   reason mentions pyyaml is reported as INVALID rather than as a block.

Per #916 the rule set and the tooldef set drift independently, so both are
fingerprinted and printed: a safety claim that does not name what it was
measured against is not a claim.
