# ci_verdict <pr-number>
#
# One command that implements the repo's CI-provenance rules as tool behaviour
# instead of reviewer discipline. Read-only; queries GitHub only. Built from
# the thirteen instrument defects catalogued on #945 — each property below
# names the defect it closes.
#
#   * FULL 40-char SHA, derived here from the PR — never typed, never a short
#     SHA. An interface that DERIVES the identifier inherits none of the ways
#     a hand-held identifier can be wrong.
#   * SERVER-SIDE filter (`--commit <sha>`) — client-side filtering over a
#     repo-scoped page inherits the pagination defect, and the partial is a
#     knife-edge, not a region: a page boundary inside the run cluster returns
#     1-of-3 looking like a complete answer. Server-side is immune to CHURN
#     (not to truncation; moot at a handful of runs per SHA).
#   * NON-EMPTY refusal — an empty set is the most stable set there is, and a
#     zero is never evidence of a cause. Retention aging, the post-push
#     scheduling window, a non-trigger-target commit, a held fork PR, and a
#     bad query are all byte-identical to "checks did not run". Refuses with
#     the differential rather than classifying.
#   * NAME-BASED FLOOR, not a count — pytest, ruff and security have no path
#     filter, so every PR expects all three BY NAME; path-filtered workflows
#     (tts-smoke) can only ADD, and the addition is derived from the PR's own
#     changed paths, never from the runs observed (an expected set derived
#     from the result being checked proves nothing). A count cannot see a
#     workflow that never started, because the missing thing is not a quantity.
#   * steps==0 DISCRIMINATOR — a run-level `failure` can be a job that never
#     ran a step (queued 15 min, cancelled). `conclusion != success` with
#     `steps == 0` is "never started", whatever the conclusion string says,
#     and without depending on provider wording ("Set up job" etc.).
#   * ATTEMPT per run — GREEN ON ATTEMPT N, never "no red": a re-run erases
#     the red it replaces, so attempt-1's failing step is fetched and shown.
#   * PRINTS names and counts unconditionally, so a human can notice what the
#     tool cannot.
#   * No exit status is read through a pipe, and no command substitution is
#     trusted for control flow without checking the substitution's own result
#     — $(cmd) discards the exit code, so a tool that prints something
#     usable-looking on failure becomes a silent garbage source.
#
# Exit: 0 green · 1 red / floor violation / refusal · 2 pending — do not conclude
